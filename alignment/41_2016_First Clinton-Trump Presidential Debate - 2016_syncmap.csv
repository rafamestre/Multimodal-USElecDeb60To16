n000031,321.960,322.320,(SILENCE)

f000084,409.540,413.940,That’s going to be a job creator like we haven’t seen since Ronald Reagan.
f000085,413.940,416.120,It’s going to be a beautiful thing to watch.
f000086,416.120,417.540,Companies will come.

f000097,451.920,457.320,And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.

f000103,487.200,488.200,I understand that.
n000043,488.200,488.640,(SILENCE)
f000104,488.640,494.360,"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that’s all to his benefit."
f000105,494.360,505.680,"He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we’ll be and that everything will work out from there."
f000106,505.680,507.640,I don’t buy that.
f000107,507.640,508.900,I have a different experience.
f000108,508.900,510.520,My father was a small-businessman.
f000109,510.520,511.800,He worked really hard.
f000110,511.800,521.360,"He printed drapery fabrics on long tables, where he pulled out those fabrics and he went down with a silkscreen and dumped the paint in and took the squeegee and kept going."

f000111,521.960,533.840,"And so what I believe is the more we can do for the middle class, the more we can invest in you, your education, your skills, your future, the better we will be off and the better we’ll grow."
f000112,533.840,536.200,That’s the kind of economy I want us to see again.
f000113,536.200,537.800,"Let me follow up with Mr. Trump, if I can."
f000114,537.800,544.280,"You’ve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you’ve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans."
f000115,544.280,549.240,How are you going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas?
f000116,549.240,553.700,"How, specifically, are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?"
f000117,553.700,568.740,"Well, for one thing—and before we start on that—my father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that’s worth many, many billions of dollars, with some of the greatest assets in the world, and I say that only because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs."
f000118,568.740,570.020,Our country’s in deep trouble.
f000119,570.020,576.920,"We don’t know what we’re doing when it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China."
f000120,576.920,579.160,"They’re the best, the best ever at it."
f000121,579.160,583.280,"What they’re doing to us is a very, very sad thing."
f000122,583.280,584.140,So we have to do that.
f000123,584.140,586.520,We have to renegotiate our trade deals.
f000124,586.520,592.020,"And, Lester, they’re taking our jobs, they’re giving incentives, they’re doing things that, frankly, we don’t do."
f000125,592.020,594.060,Let me give you the example of Mexico.
f000126,594.060,595.540,They have a VAT tax.
f000127,595.540,596.720,We’re on a different system.
f000128,596.720,600.580,"When we sell into Mexico, there’s a tax."
f000129,600.580,604.020,"When they sell in—automatic, 16 percent, approximately."
f000130,604.020,606.860,"When they sell into us, there’s no tax."
f000131,606.860,609.080,It’s a defective agreement.
f000132,609.080,613.920,"It’s been defective for a long time, many years, but the politicians haven’t done anything about it."
f000133,613.920,619.000,"Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton—yes, is that OK?"
f000134,619.000,619.660,Good.
f000135,619.660,621.480,I want you to be very happy.
f000136,621.480,622.960,It’s very important to me.
f000137,622.960,629.120,"But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently."
f000138,629.120,630.720,She’s been doing this for 30 years.
n000045,630.720,631.240,(SILENCE)
f000139,631.240,633.880,And why hasn’t she made the agreements better?
f000140,633.880,635.340,The NAFTA agreement is defective.
f000141,635.340,638.540,"Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact…"
f000142,638.540,639.500,"Let me interrupt just a moment, but…"
f000143,639.500,648.300,"Secretary Clinton and others, politicians, should have been doing this for years, not right now, because of the fact that we’ve created a movement."
f000144,648.300,650.820,They should have been doing this for years.
f000145,650.820,658.700,"What’s happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is—look, we owe $20 trillion."
f000146,658.700,662.320,"We cannot do it any longer, Lester."
f000147,662.320,663.120,"Back to the question, though."
f000148,663.120,667.520,"How do you bring back—specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers?"
f000149,667.520,668.700,How do you make them bring the jobs back?
f000150,668.700,671.000,"Well, the first thing you do is don’t let the jobs leave."
f000151,671.000,672.740,The companies are leaving.
f000152,672.740,675.060,"I could name, I mean, there are thousands of them."
f000153,675.060,677.620,"They’re leaving, and they’re leaving in bigger numbers than ever."
f000154,677.620,682.900,"And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck."
f000155,682.900,683.880,We wish you a lot of luck.
f000156,683.880,692.680,"But if you think you’re going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you’re wrong."
f000157,692.680,704.540,"And once you say you’re going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this, because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave, because in many cases, they own the companies."
f000158,704.540,708.840,"So what I’m saying is, we can stop them from leaving."
f000159,708.840,711.340,We have to stop them from leaving.
f000160,711.340,713.040,"And that’s a big, big factor."
f000161,713.040,713.920,Let me let Secretary Clinton get in here.
f000162,713.920,719.080,"Well, let’s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago."

f000338,1326.680,1327.820,Just go to her website.
f000339,1327.820,1330.120,She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.
f000340,1330.120,1333.880,I don’t think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.

f000352,1358.940,1360.680,And I want to talk about taxes.
f000353,1360.680,1363.880,The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy.
f000354,1363.880,1367.720,"Secretary Clinton, you’re calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans."
f000355,1367.720,1369.360,I’d like you to further defend that.
f000356,1369.360,1372.300,"And, Mr. Trump, you’re calling for tax cuts for the wealthy."
f000357,1372.300,1373.560,I’d like you to defend that.
f000358,1373.560,1376.200,"And this next two-minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump."
f000359,1376.200,1381.420,"Well, I’m really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs."
f000360,1381.420,1383.280,They’re going to expand their companies.
f000361,1383.280,1384.640,They’re going to do a tremendous job.
f000362,1384.640,1387.260,I’m getting rid of the carried interest provision.
f000363,1387.260,1391.760,"And if you really look, it’s not a tax—it’s really not a great thing for the wealthy."
f000364,1391.760,1393.500,It’s a great thing for the middle class.
f000365,1393.500,1395.940,It’s a great thing for companies to expand.
f000366,1395.940,1415.680,"And when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies, and when they’re going to bring $2.5 trillion back from overseas, where they can’t bring the money back, because politicians like Secretary Clinton won’t allow them to bring the money back, because the taxes are so onerous, and the bureaucratic red tape, so what—is so bad."
f000367,1415.680,1425.800,"So what they’re doing is they’re leaving our country, and they’re, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country."
f000368,1425.800,1432.300,"And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can’t work out a deal to—and everybody agrees it should be brought back."
f000369,1432.300,1442.660,"Instead of that, they’re leaving our country to get their money, because they can’t bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can’t get together."
f000370,1442.660,1448.380,Because we have—we have a president that can’t sit them around a table and get them to approve something.
f000371,1448.380,1449.120,And here’s the thing.

f000375,1460.680,1469.880,"And with a little leadership, you’d get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful."
f000376,1469.880,1471.900,But we have no leadership.

f000392,1510.040,1521.960,"I don’t see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you’re referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that’s stranded overseas."

f000800,3313.920,3318.860,And I’ve met some of the greatest people I’ll ever meet within these communities.
f000801,3318.860,3324.840,"And they are very, very upset with what their politicians have told them and what their politicians have done."

f000803,3325.800,3332.060,I think—I think—I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate.
n000205,3332.060,3332.880,(SILENCE)
f000804,3332.880,3333.640,"And, yes, I did."
n000206,3333.640,3334.960,(SILENCE)
f000805,3334.960,3336.480,And you know what else I prepared for?
f000806,3336.480,3338.220,I prepared to be president.
f000807,3338.220,3339.260,And I think that’s a good thing.
f000808,3339.260,3339.401,[applause]
f000809,3339.401,3348.660,"Mr. Trump, for five years, you perpetuated a false claim that the nation’s first black president was not a natural-born citizen."
f000810,3348.660,3350.160,You questioned his legitimacy.
f000811,3350.160,3356.660,"In the last couple of weeks, you acknowledged what most Americans have accepted for years: The president was born in the United States."
f000812,3356.660,3358.400,Can you tell us what took you so long?
f000813,3358.400,3361.360,"I’ll tell you very—well, just very simple to say."
f000814,3361.360,3370.120,Sidney Blumenthal works for the campaign and close—very close friend of Secretary Clinton.
f000815,3370.120,3381.000,"And her campaign manager, Patti Doyle, went to—during the campaign, her campaign against President Obama, fought very hard."
f000816,3381.000,3384.100,"And you can go look it up, and you can check it out."
f000817,3384.100,3393.720,"And if you look at CNN this past week, Patti Solis Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying that this happened."
f000818,3393.720,3401.180,"Blumenthal sent McClatchy, highly respected reporter at McClatchy, to Kenya to find out about it."
f000819,3401.180,3402.840,They were pressing it very hard.
n000207,3402.840,3403.160,(SILENCE)
f000820,3403.160,3405.660,She failed to get the birth certificate.
f000821,3405.660,3408.200,"When I got involved, I didn’t fail."
n000208,3408.200,3408.800,(SILENCE)
f000822,3408.800,3411.680,I got him to give the birth certificate.
f000823,3411.680,3412.980,So I’m satisfied with it.
f000824,3412.980,3414.640,And I’ll tell you why I’m satisfied with it.
f000825,3414.640,3414.920,That was…
f000826,3414.920,3414.921,[crosstalk]
f000827,3414.921,3428.180,"Because I want to get on to defeating ISIS, because I want to get on to creating jobs, because I want to get on to having a strong border, because I want to get on to things that are very important to me and that are very important to the country."
f000828,3428.180,3429.240,I will let you respond.
f000829,3429.240,3429.840,It’s important.
f000830,3429.840,3431.120,But I just want to get the answer here.
f000831,3431.120,3434.140,The birth certificate was produced in 2011.
f000832,3434.140,3440.080,"You’ve continued to tell the story and question the president’s legitimacy in 2012, ’13, ’14, ’15…"
f000833,3440.080,3440.480,Yeah.
f000834,3440.480,3440.720,….
f000835,3440.720,3442.000,as recently as January.
f000836,3442.000,3444.680,"So the question is, what changed your mind?"
f000837,3444.680,3447.760,"Well, nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it."
f000838,3447.760,3450.200,"I figured you’d ask the question tonight, of course."
f000839,3450.200,3452.080,But nobody was caring much about it.
f000840,3452.080,3456.800,But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate.
f000841,3456.800,3458.420,And I think I did a good job.
n000209,3458.420,3459.320,(SILENCE)
f000842,3459.320,3461.860,Secretary Clinton also fought it.
f000843,3461.860,3464.920,"I mean, you know—now, everybody in mainstream is going to say, oh, that’s not true."
f000844,3464.920,3465.800,"Look, it’s true."
f000845,3465.800,3476.040,"Sidney Blumenthal sent a reporter—you just have to take a look at CNN, the last week, the interview with your former campaign manager."
f000846,3476.040,3477.080,And she was involved.
n000210,3477.080,3477.760,(SILENCE)
f000847,3477.760,3480.980,"But just like she can’t bring back jobs, she can’t produce."
f000848,3480.980,3481.560,I’m sorry.
f000849,3481.560,3484.520,"I’m just going to follow up—and I will let you respond to that, because there’s a lot there."
f000850,3484.520,3487.020,But we’re talking about racial healing in this segment.
f000851,3487.020,3489.200,"What do you say to Americans, people of color who…"
f000852,3489.200,3489.201,[crosstalk]
f000853,3489.201,3490.820,"Well, it was very—I say nothing."
f000854,3490.820,3493.240,"I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it."
f000855,3493.240,3494.980,He should have produced it a long time before.
f000856,3494.980,3495.680,I say nothing.
f000857,3495.680,3496.920,But let me just tell you.
f000858,3496.920,3507.540,"When you talk about healing, I think that I’ve developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community."
f000859,3507.540,3509.880,I think you can see that.
f000860,3509.880,3513.660,And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion.
f000861,3513.660,3523.480,"And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate."
f000862,3523.480,3524.920,Secretary Clinton?
f000863,3524.920,3528.240,"Well, just listen to what you heard."
f000864,3528.240,3528.241,[laughter]
f000865,3528.241,3540.920,"And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed."
n000211,3540.920,3542.560,(SILENCE)
f000866,3542.560,3546.760,But it can’t be dismissed that easily.
f000867,3546.760,3559.520,He has really started his political activity based on this racist lie that our first black president was not an American citizen.
f000868,3559.520,3573.960,"There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it."
n000212,3573.960,3575.000,(SILENCE)
f000869,3575.000,3596.880,"But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy."
n000213,3596.880,3597.360,(SILENCE)
f000870,3597.360,3600.280,He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department.
n000214,3600.280,3601.000,(SILENCE)
f000871,3601.000,3609.540,So he has a long record of engaging in racist behavior.
f000872,3609.540,3612.680,And the birther lie was a very hurtful one.
n000215,3612.680,3613.640,(SILENCE)
f000873,3613.640,3616.760,"You know, Barack Obama is a man of great dignity."
n000216,3616.760,3618.000,(SILENCE)
f000874,3618.000,3626.480,And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.
n000217,3626.480,3627.720,(SILENCE)
f000875,3627.720,3637.560,"But I like to remember what Michelle Obama said in her amazing speech at our Democratic National Convention: When they go low, we go high."
n000218,3637.560,3638.200,(SILENCE)
f000876,3638.200,3644.600,"And Barack Obama went high, despite Donald Trump’s best efforts to bring him down."
f000877,3644.600,3647.080,"Mr. Trump, you can respond and we’re going to move on to the next segment."
f000878,3647.080,3647.480,I would love to respond.
f000879,3647.480,3651.840,"First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama."
f000880,3651.840,3655.040,You treated him with terrible disrespect.
f000881,3655.040,3659.880,And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are.
n000219,3659.880,3660.280,(SILENCE)
f000882,3660.280,3661.980,It doesn’t work that way.
f000883,3661.980,3669.760,"You were after him, you were trying to—you even sent out or your campaign sent out pictures of him in a certain garb, very famous pictures."
f000884,3669.760,3671.500,I don’t think you can deny that.
f000885,3671.500,3674.700,"But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true."
f000886,3674.700,3679.580,"So when you tried to act holier than thou, it really doesn’t work."
f000887,3679.580,3680.440,It really doesn’t.
f000888,3680.440,3693.300,"Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father’s company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country—it was a federal lawsuit—were sued."
f000889,3693.300,3697.520,We settled the suit with zero—with no admission of guilt.
n000220,3697.520,3698.360,(SILENCE)
f000890,3698.360,3699.540,It was very easy to do.
f000891,3699.540,3701.340,But they sued many people.
f000892,3701.340,3703.000,I notice you bring that up a lot.
f000893,3703.000,3708.740,"And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don’t do on you."
f000894,3708.740,3710.200,Maybe I’m trying to save the money.
f000895,3710.200,3714.760,"But, frankly, I look—I look at that, and I say, isn’t that amazing?"
f000896,3714.760,3725.260,"Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it’s just one of those things."
f000897,3725.260,3726.760,I’ll go one step further.

f000898,3727.280,3739.520,"In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it."

f000901,3751.100,3753.560,And I’m so glad I did it.
f000902,3753.560,3758.820,And I have been given great credit for what I did.
f000903,3758.820,3760.760,"And I’m very, very proud of it."

n000223,3762.100,3762.560,(SILENCE)
f000905,3762.560,3764.360,That is the true way I feel.

f001061,4520.280,4528.320,And that was—believe me—I’m sure I’m not going to get credit for it—but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.
f001062,4528.320,4546.060,"I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton."
