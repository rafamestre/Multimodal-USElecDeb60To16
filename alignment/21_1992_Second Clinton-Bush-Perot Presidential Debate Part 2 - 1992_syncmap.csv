f000002,0.840,1.040,Thank you.
f000003,1.040,1.900,We have a question right here.
n000001,1.900,2.720,(SILENCE)
f000004,2.720,3.040,Yes.
f000005,3.040,8.000,How has the national debt personally affected each of your lives?
f000006,8.000,17.120,"And if it hasn't, how can you honestly find a cure for the economic problems of the common people if you have no experience in what's ailing them?"
n000002,17.120,20.560,(SILENCE)
f000007,20.560,21.640,May I answer that?
f000008,21.640,24.220,"Well, Mr. Perot -- yes, of course."
f000009,24.220,25.240,Who do you want to start with?
f000010,25.240,26.540,"My question is for each of you, so-"
f000011,26.540,32.460,It caused me to disrupt my private life and my business to get involved in this activity.
n000003,32.460,33.240,(SILENCE)
f000012,33.240,35.240,That's how much I care about it.
f000013,35.240,43.400,"And believe me, if you knew my family and if you knew the private life I have, you would agree in a minute that that's a whole lot more fun than getting involved in politics."
f000014,43.400,45.420,But I have lived the American dream.
f000015,45.420,47.600,I came from very modest background.
f000016,47.600,55.160,"Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children."
f000017,55.160,56.720,That's true of any family.
f000018,56.720,65.940,But I want all the children -- I want these young people up here to be able to start with nothing but an idea like I did and build a business.
n000004,65.940,66.360,(SILENCE)
f000019,66.360,72.940,"But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you."
f000020,72.940,80.280,"I just figure, as lucky as I've been, I owe it to them and I owe it to the future generations and on a very personal basis, I owe it to my children and grandchildren."
f000021,80.280,83.740,"Thank you, Mr. Perot."
f000022,83.740,84.080,Mr. President.
f000023,84.080,87.280,"Well, I think the national debt affects everybody."
f000024,87.280,87.680,You personally.
f000025,87.680,90.600,Obviously it has a lot to do with interest rates --

f000028,94.520,96.560,Has it affected you personally?
n000006,96.560,97.200,(SILENCE)
f000029,97.200,98.080,I'm sure it has.

f000032,101.560,104.400,I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.
n000008,104.400,104.960,(SILENCE)
f000033,104.960,107.140,I think that that's an important part of being a parent.
f000034,107.140,109.900,If the question -- maybe I -- get it wrong.
f000035,109.900,115.500,Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?
f000036,115.500,116.160,What I'm saying is --
f000037,116.160,120.120,I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.
f000038,120.120,122.400,"Well, I've had friends that have been laid off from jobs."
f000039,122.400,122.560,Yeah.
f000040,122.560,126.860,"I know people who cannot afford to pay the mortgage on their homes, their car payment."
f000041,126.860,130.160,I have personal problems with the national debt.
n000009,130.160,130.640,(SILENCE)
f000042,130.640,136.760,"But how has it affected you and if you have no experience in it, how can you help us, if you don't know what we're feeling?"
f000043,136.760,143.880,I think she means more the recession -- the economic problems today the country faces rather than the deficit.
f000044,143.880,153.000,"Well, listen, you ought to be in the White House for a day and hear what I hear and see what I see and read the mail I read and touch the people that I touch from time to time."

n000015,188.320,188.760,(SILENCE)
f000054,188.760,196.400,But everybody's affected by the debt because of the tremendous interest that goes into paying on that debt everything's more expensive.

f000055,196.880,199.860,Everything comes out of your pocket and my pocket.
f000056,199.860,200.600,So it's that.
f000057,200.600,205.220,"But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US."
f000058,205.220,211.460,"And that's why I'm trying to do something about it by stimulating the export, vesting more, better education systems."

f000059,212.360,212.760,Thank you.
f000060,212.760,214.080,I'm glad you clarified it.
f000061,214.080,214.680,Governor Clinton.
f000062,214.680,217.480,Tell me how it's affected you again.

n000025,267.980,268.480,(SILENCE)
f000074,268.480,273.780,What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.
f000075,273.780,276.900,It is because America has not invested in its people.
f000076,276.900,278.240,It is because we have not grown.
n000026,278.240,278.560,(SILENCE)
f000077,278.560,281.440,It is because we've had 12 years of trickle down economics.

f000078,281.880,284.240,We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages.

f000083,304.000,312.480,"I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again."
f000084,312.480,312.800,Thank you.
f000085,312.800,314.400,"Thank you, Governor Clinton."
f000086,314.400,323.780,"We are a little more than halfway through this program and I'm glad we're getting the diversity of questions that we are, and I don't want to forget these folks on the wings over here so let's go over here."

f000096,379.960,381.360,"President Bush, may we start with you?"
f000097,381.360,388.840,"Well, the Social Security -- you're an expert and I could, I'm sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund."
f000098,388.840,395.320,"The Social Security system was fixed about 5 years, and I think it's projected out to be sound beyond that."
n000040,395.320,395.680,(SILENCE)
f000099,395.680,397.780,So at least we have time to work with it.
f000100,397.780,402.840,"But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going."

f000101,403.400,408.260,Growth in the economy is gonna add to the overall prosperity and wealth.
f000102,408.260,412.140,I can't give you a specific answer on Pension Guarantee Fund.
f000103,412.140,416.740,All I know is that we have firm government credit to guarantee the pensions.
n000042,416.740,417.200,(SILENCE)
f000104,417.200,419.100,And that is very important.
f000105,419.100,426.240,"But it's -- the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good."
n000043,426.240,426.800,(SILENCE)
f000106,426.800,428.820,It's still the most respected credit.
f000107,428.820,435.600,"So I would simply say, as these dates get close, you're going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security Fund."
f000108,435.600,437.840,And I think that's the only answer.
f000109,437.840,448.160,"But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure."

n000045,463.600,463.960,(SILENCE)
f000112,463.960,465.560,And it's a big fight.

f000114,471.660,473.220,And you can't just go up and say I'm going to fix it.
f000115,473.220,476.780,You've got some pretty strong-willed guys up there that argue with you.
f000116,476.780,478.080,But that's what the election's about.
