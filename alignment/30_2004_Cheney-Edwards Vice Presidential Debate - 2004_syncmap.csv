f000017,116.780,123.740,Donald Rumsfeld said he has not seen any hard evidence of a link between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein.
f000018,123.740,133.760,Was this approved -- of a report that you requested that you received a week ago that showed there was no connection between Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein?

f000021,142.400,148.240,It's important to look at all of our developments in Iraq within the broader context of the global war on terror.
f000022,148.240,166.240,"And, after 9/11, it became clear that we had to do several things to have a successful strategy to win the global war on terror, specifically that we had to go after the terrorists wherever we might find them, that we also had to go after state sponsors of terror, those who might provide sanctuary or safe harbor for terror."
f000023,166.240,180.840,"And we also then finally had to stand up democracies in their stead afterwards, because that was the only way to guarantee that these states would not again become safe harbors for terror or for the development of deadly weapons."
f000024,180.840,199.080,"Concern about Iraq specifically focused on the fact that Saddam Hussein had been, for years, listed on the state sponsor of terror, that they he had established relationships with Abu Nidal, who operated out of Baghdad; he paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers; and he had an established relationship with Al Qaida."

f000026,209.680,221.880,The effort that we've mounted with respect to Iraq focused specifically on the possibility that this was the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction.
f000027,221.880,232.480,The biggest threat we faced today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans.
f000028,232.480,235.100,What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do.

f000052,343.480,345.040,We've made significant progress in Iraq.
f000053,345.040,348.640,We've stood up a new government that's been in power now only 90 days.
f000054,348.640,361.400,"The notion of additional troops is talked about frequently, but the point of success in Iraq will be reached when we have turned governance over to the Iraqi people; they have been able to establish a democratic government."
f000055,361.400,362.280,They're well on their way to doing that.
f000056,362.280,365.180,They will have free elections next January for the first time in history.
f000057,365.180,369.920,"We also are actively, rapidly training Iraqis to take on the security responsibility."
f000058,369.920,373.320,Those two steps are crucial to success in Iraq.
f000059,373.320,374.680,"They're well in hand, well under way."
f000060,374.680,377.720,"And I'm confident that, in fact, we'll get the job done."
f000061,377.720,379.400,"You have 30 seconds, Senator."
f000062,379.400,379.660,Yes.
f000063,379.660,385.720,"Mr. Vice President, there is no connection between the attacks of September 11th and Saddam Hussein."
f000064,385.720,387.320,The 9/11 Commission has said it.
n000027,387.320,387.800,(SILENCE)
f000065,387.800,390.360,Your own secretary of state has said it.
n000028,390.360,390.760,(SILENCE)
f000066,390.760,394.320,And you've gone around the country suggesting that there is some connection.
f000067,394.320,394.880,There is not.
n000029,394.880,395.280,(SILENCE)
f000068,395.280,403.520,And in fact the CIA is now about to report that the connection between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein is tenuous at best.
f000069,403.520,409.200,"And, in fact, the secretary of defense said yesterday that he knows of no hard evidence of the connection."
f000070,409.200,411.080,We need to be straight with the American people.
f000071,411.080,413.220,Time for a new question but the same topic.
f000072,413.220,415.500,"And this time to you, Senator Edwards."
f000073,415.500,420.780,You and Senator Kerry have said that the war in Iraq is the wrong war at the wrong time.
f000074,420.780,425.480,Does that mean that if you had been president and vice president that Saddam Hussein would still be in power?
n000030,425.480,425.960,(SILENCE)
f000075,425.960,429.920,Here's what it means: It means that Saddam Hussein needed to be confronted.
n000031,429.920,430.440,(SILENCE)
f000076,430.440,432.740,John Kerry and I have consistently said that.
f000077,432.740,434.400,That's why we voted for the resolution.
n000032,434.400,434.960,(SILENCE)
f000078,434.960,437.320,But it also means it needed to be done the right way.
n000033,437.320,437.920,(SILENCE)
f000079,437.920,456.520,"And doing it the right way meant that we were prepared; that we gave the weapons inspectors time to find out what we now know, that in fact there were no weapons of mass destruction; that we didn't take our eye off the ball, which are Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, the people who attacked us on September the 11th."
n000034,456.520,457.120,(SILENCE)
f000080,457.120,461.240,"Now, remember, we went into Afghanistan, which, by the way, was the right thing to do."
n000035,461.240,461.840,(SILENCE)
f000081,461.840,462.600,That was the right decision.
f000082,462.600,465.320,And our military performed terrifically there.
f000083,465.320,467.920,But we had Osama bin Laden cornered at Tora Bora.
n000036,467.920,468.680,(SILENCE)
f000084,468.680,472.520,We had the 10th Mountain Division up in Uzbekistan available.
n000037,472.520,473.040,(SILENCE)
f000085,473.040,475.880,We had the finest military in the world on the ground.
f000086,475.880,477.920,And what did we do?
f000087,477.920,484.080,We turned -- this is the man who masterminded the greatest mass murder and terrorist attack in American history.
f000088,484.080,485.600,And what did the administration decide to do?
n000038,485.600,486.440,(SILENCE)
f000089,486.440,498.860,"They gave the responsibility of capturing and/or killing Saddam -- I mean Osama bin Laden to Afghan warlords who, just a few weeks before, had been working with Osama bin Laden."
f000090,498.860,505.320,Our point in this is not complicated: We were attacked by Al Qaida and Osama bin Laden.
f000091,505.320,515.600,We went into Afghanistan and very quickly the administration made a decision to divert attention from that and instead began to plan for the invasion of Iraq.
n000039,515.600,516.360,(SILENCE)
f000092,516.360,519.480,And these connections -- I want the American people to hear this very clearly.
f000093,519.480,522.120,Listen carefully to what the vice president is saying.
n000040,522.120,522.680,(SILENCE)
f000094,522.680,529.760,Because there is no connection between Saddam Hussein and the attacks of September 11th -- period.
f000095,529.760,531.800,The 9/11 Commission has said that's true.
n000041,531.800,532.200,(SILENCE)
f000096,532.200,533.760,Colin Powell has said it's true.
n000042,533.760,534.240,(SILENCE)
f000097,534.240,537.020,But the vice president keeps suggesting that there is.
f000098,537.020,537.840,There is not.
n000043,537.840,538.200,(SILENCE)
f000099,538.200,541.740,"And, in fact, any connection with Al Qaida is tenuous at best."
f000100,541.740,544.040,"Mr. Vice President, you have 90 seconds to respond."
f000101,544.040,545.560,The senator has got his facts wrong.
f000102,545.560,554.620,"I have not suggested there's a connection between Iraq and 9/11, but there's clearly an established Iraqi track record with terror."
f000103,554.620,565.400,"And the point is that that's the place where you're most likely to see the terrorists come together with weapons of mass destruction, the deadly technologies that Saddam Hussein had developed and used over the years."
f000104,565.400,571.800,"Now, the fact of the matter is, the big difference here, Gwen, is they are not prepared to deal with states that sponsor terror."
f000105,571.800,576.880,They've got a very limited view about how to use U.S. military forces to defend America.
f000106,576.880,586.600,We heard Senator Kerry say the other night that there ought to be some kind of global test before U.S. troops are deployed preemptively to protect the United States.
f000107,586.600,594.260,That's part of a track record that goes back to the 1970s when he ran for Congress the first time and said troops should not be deployed without U.N. approval.
n000044,594.260,595.120,(SILENCE)
f000108,595.120,600.720,"Then, in the mid-'80s, he ran on the basis of cutting most of our major defense programs."
f000109,600.720,604.120,"In 1991, he voted against Desert Storm."
f000110,604.120,609.080,It's a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defense issues.
f000111,609.080,618.960,A little tough talk in the midst of a campaign or as part of a presidential debate cannot obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defense issues.
f000112,618.960,633.200,"And they give absolutely no indication, based on that record, of being wiling to go forward and aggressively pursue the war on terror with a kind of strategy that will work, that will defeat our enemies and will guarantee that the United States doesn't again get attacked by the likes of Al Qaida."
f000113,633.200,638.740,"You will respond to that topic, but first I want to ask you for two minutes, Vice President Cheney."
f000114,638.740,641.840,Tonight we mentioned Afghanistan.
f000115,641.840,646.700,We believe that Osama bin Laden is hiding perhaps in a cave somewhere along the Afghan-Pakistan border.
f000116,646.700,654.260,"If you get a second term, what is your plan to capture him and then to neutralize those who have sprung up to replace him?"
f000117,654.260,657.900,"Gwen, we've never let up on Osama bin Laden from day one."
f000118,657.900,659.860,We've actively and aggressively pursued him.
f000119,659.860,666.280,We've captured or killed thousands of Al Qaida in various places around the world and especially in Afghanistan.
f000120,666.280,670.560,"We'll continue to very aggressively pursue him, and I'm confident eventually we'll get him."
f000121,670.560,685.340,"The key to success in Afghanistan has been, again, to go in and go after the terrorists, which we've done, and also take down the Taliban regime which allowed them to function there, in effect sponsors, if you will, of the Al Qaida organization."
f000122,685.340,697.000,"John Edwards, two and a half years ago, six months after we went into Afghanistan announced that it was chaotic, the situation was deteriorating, the warlords were about to take over."
f000123,697.000,703.800,"Here we are, two and a half years later, we're four days away from a democratic election, the first one in history in Afghanistan."
f000124,703.800,708.640,"We've got 10 million voters who have registered to vote, nearly half of them women."
f000125,708.640,713.460,That election will put in place a democratically elected government that will take over next December.
f000126,713.460,723.320,"We've made enormous progress in Afghanistan, in exactly the right direction, in spite of what John Edwards said two and a half years ago."
f000127,723.320,724.340,He just got it wrong.
f000128,724.340,731.300,"The fact is, as we go forward in Afghanistan, we will pursue Osama bin Laden and the terrorists as long as necessary."
f000129,731.300,736.280,We're standing up Afghan security forces so they can take on responsibility for their own security.
f000130,736.280,745.140,"We'll keep U.S. forces there -- we have about 16,000 there today -- as long as necessary, to assist the Afghans in terms of dealing with their security situation."
f000131,745.140,747.200,But they're making significant progress.
f000132,747.200,749.880,"We have President Karzai, who is in power."

f000133,750.280,754.540,They have done wonders writing their own constitution for the first time ever.

f000135,756.160,757.800,Young girls are going to school.

f000137,759.320,760.960,Women are even eligible to run for office.
f000138,760.960,763.000,"This is major, major progress."
f000139,763.000,766.880,"There will be democracy in Afghanistan, make no doubt about it."
f000140,766.880,770.200,Freedom is the best antidote to terror.
f000141,770.200,771.880,"Senator Edwards, you have 90 seconds."
f000142,771.880,773.120,Someone did get it wrong.
n000046,773.120,773.480,(SILENCE)
f000143,773.480,775.420,But it wasn't John Kerry and John Edwards.
f000144,775.420,777.040,They got it wrong.
f000145,777.040,781.920,"When we had Osama bin Laden cornered, they left the job to the Afghan warlords."
n000047,781.920,782.480,(SILENCE)
f000146,782.480,789.600,"They then diverted their attention from the very people who attacked us, who were at the center of the war on terror, and so Osama bin Laden is still at large."

f000461,2533.120,2534.960,And Israel has a right to defend itself.

f000476,2604.300,2608.960,The first time I ever met you was when you walked on the stage tonight.
f000477,2608.960,2622.000,"In respect to Israel and Palestine, Gwen, the suicide bombers, in part, were generated by Saddam Hussein, who paid $25,000 to the families of suicide bombers."
f000478,2622.000,2630.860,I personally think one of the reasons that we don't have as many suicide attacks today in Israel as we've had in the past is because Saddam is no longer in business.
f000479,2630.860,2634.120,We've been strong supporters of Israel.
f000480,2634.120,2643.980,The president stepped forward and put in place a policy basically that said we will support the establishment of two states.
f000481,2643.980,2649.180,First president ever to say we'll establish and support a Palestinian state nextdoor to Israelis.
f000482,2649.180,2653.080,"But first, there has to be an interlocutor you can trust and deal with."
f000483,2653.080,2656.280,"And we won't have that, we don't have it now, in a Yasser Arafat."
f000484,2656.280,2658.460,There has to be reform of the Palestinian system.

f000486,2661.460,2662.960,That was a complete distortion of my record.

f000501,2715.800,2718.680,I think it goes to Senator Edwards.
f000502,2718.680,2719.960,It goes to the Senator.
f000503,2719.960,2720.640,I see you.
f000504,2720.640,2724.600,"I just asked him about Israel, even though we didn't actually talk about it much."
f000505,2724.600,2725.200,I concede the point.

f000509,2729.160,2736.080,"Mr. Vice President, the Census Bureau ranked Cleveland as the biggest poor city in the country, 31 percent jobless rate."
f000510,2736.080,2738.260,You two gentlemen are pretty well off.
f000511,2738.260,2740.080,You did well for yourselves in the private sector.
f000512,2740.080,2747.160,"What can you tell the people of Cleveland, or people of cities like Cleveland, that your administration will do to better their lives?"
f000513,2747.160,2751.240,"Well, Gwen, there are several things that I think need to be done and are being done."
f000514,2751.240,2759.640,"We've, of course, been through a difficult recession, and then the aftermath of 9/11, where we lost over a million jobs after that attack."
f000515,2759.640,2765.580,"But we think the key is to address some basic, fundamental issues that the president's already working on."
f000516,2765.580,2771.760,I think probably the most successful thing we can do with respect to ending poverty is to get people jobs.
f000517,2771.760,2777.600,"There's no better antidote to poverty than a good, well-paying job that allows somebody to take care of their own family."
f000518,2777.600,2781.940,"To do that, we have to make America the best place in the world to do business."
f000519,2781.940,2785.120,And that means we've got to deal effectively with tax policy.
f000520,2785.120,2789.040,We've got to reduce the litigation costs that are built into our society.
f000521,2789.040,2799.540,"We've got to provide the adequate medical care and make certain that we can, in fact, create the opportunities that are vital to that process."

f000525,2808.480,2813.760,"And the president, his first legislative priority was the No Child Left Behind Act."
f000526,2813.760,2816.100,It was the first piece of legislation we introduced.
f000527,2816.100,2819.040,We got it passed that first summer on a bipartisan basis.
f000528,2819.040,2820.780,We even had Ted Kennedy on board for the effort.
n000156,2820.780,2821.200,(SILENCE)
f000529,2821.200,2823.680,And it does several things.
f000530,2823.680,2826.200,It establishes high standards.
f000531,2826.200,2838.160,"It, at the same time, sets up a system of testing with respect to our school system, so we can establish accountability to parents and make certain that they understand how well their students are doing."
f000532,2838.160,2843.540,And they have the opportunity to move students out of poorly performing schools to good schools.
f000533,2843.540,2848.040,It strikes me that that is absolutely the heart of what needs to be done from the standpoint of education.
f000534,2848.040,2858.000,"It's also important, as we go forward in the next term, we want to be able to take what we've done for elementary education and move it into the secondary education."
f000535,2858.000,2858.600,It's working.

f000538,2866.940,2868.700,"Senator Edwards, you have 90 seconds."
f000539,2868.700,2870.480,"Gwen, your question was about jobs?"
f000540,2870.480,2872.600,"It was about jobs, and it was about poverty."
f000541,2872.600,2874.980,I thought it was about jobs and poverty.
f000542,2874.980,2878.720,"I hope we get a chance to talk about education, but that's what the vice president talked about."
f000543,2878.720,2892.680,"Here's what's happened: In the time that they have been in office, in the last four years, 1.6 million private sector jobs have been lost, 2.7 million manufacturing jobs have been lost."

f000870,4653.880,4657.760,And those very special qualities are vital in a commander in chief.

f000879,4702.180,4705.760,I'm the first in my family to graduate from college.

f000897,4797.520,4801.840,And one thing that John Kerry and I would agree with you about is that it is...

f000949,5074.000,5081.920,The question of troops is an interesting and important one.
f000950,5081.920,5085.960,We have looked to our commanders on the ground in Iraq for guidance on what they think they need.
