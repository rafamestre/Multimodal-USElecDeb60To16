f000001,9.000,10.240,Good evening.
n000001,10.240,10.560,(SILENCE)
f000002,10.560,18.960,On behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates I am pleased to welcome you to this first presidential debate of the 1988 campaign.
n000002,18.960,19.640,(SILENCE)
f000003,19.640,22.460,I'm Jim Lehrer of the McNeil-Lehrer News Hour.
f000004,22.460,33.500,My colleagues on the panel are John Mashek of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution; Ann Groer of The Orlando Sentinel; and Peter Jennings of ABC News.
n000003,33.500,34.640,(SILENCE)
f000005,34.640,50.740,For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates for president of the United States following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two candidates.
f000006,50.740,93.040,"The candidates are Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee; Governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee."
f000007,93.040,93.041,(Applause)
f000008,93.041,97.000,Our questions this evening will be about equally divided between foreign and domestic policy matters.
n000004,97.000,97.360,(SILENCE)
f000009,97.360,102.160,The first question by agreement between the two candidates goes to Vice President Bush.
n000005,102.160,102.800,(SILENCE)
f000010,102.800,104.200,It is a domestic question.
n000006,104.200,104.720,(SILENCE)
f000011,104.720,106.800,"You have two minutes for an answer, sir."
n000007,106.800,108.040,(SILENCE)
f000012,108.040,114.880,The polls say the number one domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs.
n000008,114.880,115.960,(SILENCE)
f000013,115.960,123.740,What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs?
n000009,123.740,126.520,(SILENCE)
f000014,126.520,129.680,I think we've seen a deterioration of values.
n000010,129.680,130.600,(SILENCE)
f000015,130.600,135.040,I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned.
n000011,135.040,136.040,(SILENCE)
f000016,136.040,148.120,"For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong."
n000012,148.120,148.640,(SILENCE)
f000017,148.640,160.920,"So we've seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools."
f000018,160.920,165.920,"We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing."
n000013,165.920,166.400,(SILENCE)
f000019,166.400,171.920,And I don't believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use.
n000014,171.920,172.400,(SILENCE)
f000020,172.400,179.840,"And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction."
f000021,179.840,189.600,"But we've got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes."
n000015,189.600,189.960,(SILENCE)
f000022,189.960,192.900,We've got to get after the users more.
f000023,192.900,196.260,We have to change this whole culture.
f000024,196.260,199.720,"You know, I saw a movie - ""Crocodile Dundee."""
n000016,199.720,200.600,(SILENCE)
f000025,200.600,209.320,"And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident."
f000026,209.320,210.660,And it's bad.
f000027,210.660,211.880,Everybody ought to be in this thing.
n000017,211.880,212.480,(SILENCE)
f000028,212.480,217.000,"Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education."
f000029,217.000,221.080,And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.
f000030,221.080,226.440,But we have got to instill values in these young people.
f000031,226.440,240.100,And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods.
f000032,240.100,246.520,"But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools."
n000018,246.520,248.160,(SILENCE)
f000033,248.160,249.720,"Governor, you have one minute to respond."
n000019,249.720,250.160,(SILENCE)
f000034,250.160,252.040,I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.
f000035,252.040,256.920,But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.
f000036,256.920,262.960,That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.
n000020,262.960,264.480,(SILENCE)
f000037,264.480,268.080,Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.
n000021,268.080,269.400,(SILENCE)
f000038,269.400,272.480,We've been dealing with him; he's been dealing drugs to our kids.
n000022,272.480,273.720,(SILENCE)
f000039,273.720,276.460,Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.
n000023,276.460,277.520,(SILENCE)
f000040,277.520,289.560,"I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help."
n000024,289.560,290.640,(SILENCE)
f000041,290.640,292.160,We're providing that young woman with help.
n000025,292.160,293.520,(SILENCE)
f000042,293.520,303.720,"But I want to be a president of the United States who makes sure that we never again do business with a drug-running Panamanian dictator, that we never again funnel aid to the contras through convicted drug dealers."
n000026,303.720,304.160,(SILENCE)
f000043,304.160,307.280,"Values begin at the top, in the White House."
f000044,307.280,312.280,Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.
n000027,312.280,313.840,(SILENCE)
f000045,313.840,315.520,"Governor, a follow-up question."
f000046,315.520,317.200,You have two minutes to answer it.
n000028,317.200,317.840,(SILENCE)
f000047,317.840,324.320,"Are you suggesting, sir, that President Reagan is one of the causes of the drug problem in this country?"
f000048,324.320,340.960,"I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention."
f000049,340.960,345.320,And Mr. Bush is right - the two go hand in hand.
f000050,345.320,367.820,"But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you."
n000029,367.820,368.600,(SILENCE)
f000051,368.600,384.720,"Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together."
n000030,384.720,386.440,(SILENCE)
f000052,386.440,388.200,But we also have to take demand seriously.
f000053,388.200,390.760,"You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country."
n000031,390.760,391.320,(SILENCE)
f000054,391.320,393.360,We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.
n000032,393.360,394.960,(SILENCE)
f000055,394.960,403.160,And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.
f000056,403.160,406.760,We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.
f000057,406.760,419.160,"And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America."
f000058,419.160,425.800,"And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances."
n000033,425.800,426.760,(SILENCE)
f000059,426.760,437.360,"I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country."
n000034,437.360,438.320,(SILENCE)
f000060,438.320,456.520,"If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country."
f000061,456.520,458.360,"A minute to rebut, Mr. Vice President."
n000035,458.360,458.920,(SILENCE)
f000062,458.920,463.280,"Well, the other day my opponent was given a briefing by the CIA."
n000036,463.280,464.120,(SILENCE)
f000063,464.120,466.200,I asked for and received the same briefing.
n000037,466.200,466.840,(SILENCE)
f000064,466.840,470.840,I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information.
n000038,470.840,471.440,(SILENCE)
f000065,471.440,473.600,And what I'm about to say is unclassified.
n000039,473.600,474.480,(SILENCE)
f000066,474.480,477.480,Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega.
n000040,477.480,477.800,(SILENCE)
f000067,477.800,481.720,It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.
n000041,481.720,482.320,(SILENCE)
f000068,482.320,494.720,"And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him."
n000042,494.720,495.360,(SILENCE)
f000069,495.360,501.660,And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.
f000070,501.660,503.240,Panama is a friendly country.
f000071,503.240,516.240,"I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him."
f000072,516.240,517.980,And we want to bring him to justice.
f000073,517.980,524.800,And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.
n000043,524.800,526.120,(SILENCE)
f000074,526.120,528.900,"All right, the next question will be asked by John Mashek."
f000075,528.900,531.780,"It goes to Governor Dukakis, and you'll have two minutes to answer."
n000044,531.780,532.720,(SILENCE)
f000076,532.720,537.520,"Governor Dukakis, another troublesome issue for voters this year is the bulging federal deficit."
n000045,537.520,538.320,(SILENCE)
f000077,538.320,543.440,"In a Dukakis administration, you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort."
n000046,543.440,544.000,(SILENCE)
f000078,544.000,551.240,Would you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down?
n000047,551.240,552.120,(SILENCE)
f000079,552.120,554.280,"Yes, I've been very specific about those, John."
f000080,554.280,564.060,"And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices."
f000081,564.060,569.180,"First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford."
f000082,569.180,573.920,"Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make."
f000083,573.920,578.600,"I've also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I've outlined those in detail."
n000048,578.600,579.280,(SILENCE)
f000084,579.280,582.640,"Secondly, we've got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country."
n000049,582.640,583.320,(SILENCE)
f000085,583.320,587.300,Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit.
f000086,587.300,594.840,"Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down."
f000087,594.840,601.240,"And, finally, we've got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid to this country."
f000088,601.240,609.200,It's very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected.
f000089,609.200,613.280,I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.
f000090,613.280,624.720,"We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration."
n000050,624.720,625.320,(SILENCE)
f000091,625.320,634.600,"We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again."
n000051,634.600,635.600,(SILENCE)
f000092,635.600,644.480,The thing I don't understand about Mr. Bush's approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do.
n000052,644.480,645.240,(SILENCE)
f000093,645.240,661.560,"He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break."
f000094,661.560,665.540,He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.
f000095,665.540,670.280,"If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics."
f000096,670.280,670.281,(Laughter)
f000097,670.281,680.400,But I hope you won't take my five seconds away from me.
f000098,680.400,681.160,I will say this -
f000099,681.160,682.160,"Your two minutes is up, Governor."
f000100,682.160,691.680,"If he's serious about what he's saying, then the only place he can go to balance that budget is to raid the Social Security Trust Fund, and he tried that in 1985, and I think he's going to try it again."
n000053,691.680,692.240,(SILENCE)
f000101,692.240,693.320,You have a minute to rebut.
f000102,693.320,696.160,Is this the time to unleash our one-liners?
f000103,696.160,700.120,That answer was about as clear as Boston harbor.
f000104,700.120,700.121,(Laughter)
f000105,700.121,709.120,Let me help the governor.
f000106,709.120,712.300,"There are so many things there, I don't quite know where to begin."
n000054,712.300,712.880,(SILENCE)
f000107,712.880,715.780,"When you cut capital gains, you put people to work."
n000055,715.780,716.400,(SILENCE)
f000108,716.400,719.480,John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains.
n000056,719.480,720.040,(SILENCE)
f000109,720.040,727.040,"Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut."
f000110,727.040,728.760,It's not going to cost the government money.
f000111,728.760,734.160,"It's going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it's going to create jobs."
f000112,734.160,738.080,So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.
f000113,738.080,746.160,"Massachusetts doesn't have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times."
f000114,746.160,748.280,That happens to be a fact.
f000115,748.280,756.280,"And so let's kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze."
f000116,756.280,768.480,"And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes."
n000057,768.480,769.000,(SILENCE)
f000117,769.000,770.680,"Your time is up, too."
f000118,770.680,771.600,"A follow-up, John."
n000058,771.600,772.280,(SILENCE)
f000119,772.280,784.480,"Mr. Vice President, you have vowed not to raise taxes of any kind during your administration and at the same time you've proposed this capital gains cut, you've proposed more incentive breaks for the oil industry."
f000120,784.480,793.660,You've suggested new spending programs and even some Republicans say the flexible freeze you just spoke about will hardly make a dent in the deficit.
f000121,793.660,799.240,"Is the deficit no longer really a concern of yours, the Republican Party or the taxpayers?"
f000122,799.240,802.440,I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.
n000059,802.440,802.920,(SILENCE)
f000123,802.920,810.660,"And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we've got to get the Democrats - Congress under control."
n000060,810.660,811.080,(SILENCE)
f000124,811.080,815.120,"They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime."
f000125,815.120,821.920,"I'd like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto."
f000126,821.920,826.200,He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso.
f000127,826.200,828.420,I would like a balanced budget amendment.
f000128,828.420,836.840,But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.
f000129,836.840,846.000,So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.
n000061,846.000,846.360,(SILENCE)
f000130,846.360,848.760,It is that we are continuing to spend too much.
f000131,848.760,853.480,"So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation."
f000132,853.480,857.760,Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.
f000133,857.760,864.880,"And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987."
f000134,864.880,870.680,And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.

f000270,1683.200,1702.740,"You've used the phrase ""card carrying"" so many times since Governor Dukakis first acknowledged that he was a card carrying member of the ACLU that some people have come to believe that you've used it to brand him in some way, to identify him as people were identified in the 1950's as less than patriotic."

f000532,3058.760,3065.000,The fact happens to be that education spending is up by the federal government; it is up.
f000533,3065.000,3066.680,It is not down.
f000534,3066.680,3068.320,But here's the point he misses.

f000535,3068.800,3086.120,"The federal government spends seven percent of the total on education, and the rest of the state governments and local governments and the thousand points of lightened I'm talking about private schools and private church schools and things of this nature--are putting up 93 percent."
f000536,3086.120,3094.180,"But the federal spending for education is up, and I want to be the education president, because I want to see us do better."
f000537,3094.180,3099.720,"We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should."
f000538,3099.720,3103.380,We've gotten away fro values and the fundamentals.
f000539,3103.380,3112.780,And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.
f000540,3112.780,3113.400,And we can do it.
f000541,3113.400,3118.640,"But itÏ€s not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C."

f000544,3126.680,3135.100,"Governor, the vice president continually refers to your lack of experience, weakness, naivete on foreign policy and national security matters."
f000545,3135.100,3142.700,He says you are prepared to eliminate weapons system that will result in the unilateral disarmament of this country.

f000548,3145.520,3149.120,Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.
f000549,3149.120,3153.880,I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.
f000550,3153.880,3157.520,"Remember that, George?"
n000234,3157.520,3157.880,(SILENCE)

f000553,3169.320,3170.640,It's not the length of your resume.
n000235,3170.640,3171.480,(SILENCE)
f000554,3171.480,3175.340,"It's your strength, it's your values, it's the quality of the people you pick."

n000236,3185.160,3186.720,(SILENCE)
f000556,3186.720,3187.800,The vice president has a long resume.
f000557,3187.800,3192.560,But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.
n000237,3192.560,3193.320,(SILENCE)
f000558,3193.320,3203.180,"And we now know that he was not out of the loop; he was in meeting after meeting listening to Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger opposing that, and yet he supported it."
f000559,3203.180,3215.200,His experience didn't prevent him from participating or involving or in some way being involved in the relationship between this government and Mr. Noriega and drug trafficking in Panama.

f000560,3216.320,3220.440,He went to Philippines in the early 80Ï€s and commended Ferdinand Macros for his commitment to democracy.

f000562,3231.320,3240.600,So I don't believe that the fact you've got that long resume or had that experience is the real question.
f000563,3240.600,3246.680,"The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided."
f000564,3246.680,3247.920,I'm ready to provide that leadership.
f000565,3247.920,3250.080,I want to be the commander in chief of this country.

f000566,3250.480,3267.740,"I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros."
f000567,3267.740,3270.800,But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.
f000568,3270.800,3271.480,It's strength; it's values.
f000569,3271.480,3272.020,Mr. Vice President.

f000570,3273.080,3275.820,"Well, I thought the question was about defense."
f000571,3275.820,3284.120,The governor was for a nuclear freeze that would have locked in a thousand Soviet intermediate nuclear force weapons and zero for the West.
f000572,3284.120,3293.280,"And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age."
f000573,3293.280,3303.580,"Now, we're sitting down and talking to the Soviets about strategic arms, and he wants to do away with the Midgetman and the MX, the modernization or our nuclear capability."
f000574,3303.580,3305.900,That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.
f000575,3305.900,3307.620,I've met Mr. Gorbachev.
f000576,3307.620,3310.460,Met Mr. Shevardnadze and talked substance with him the other day.
f000577,3310.460,3312.300,These people are tough.
f000578,3312.300,3314.060,But now we have a chance.
f000579,3314.060,3327.120,"I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world."
f000580,3327.120,3335.360,"And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days."
f000581,3335.360,3337.660,"As to Ferdinand Marcos, he isn't there any more."
f000582,3337.660,3340.880,It was under our administration that Mrs. Aquino came in.

f000588,3350.120,3351.140,And he just lifted martial law.
f000589,3351.140,3353.540,And he just called for new elections.
f000590,3353.540,3358.400,And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.
f000591,3358.400,3359.000,And out he goes.

f000595,3370.440,3382.920,Are you prepared to tell the voters one system in this time of tight budgetary restraints and problems at the Pentagon that you'd be willing to cut or even eliminate that wouldn't endanger national security?

f000600,3388.520,3389.800,And I can go on and on.
f000601,3389.800,3392.200,"Minuteman III, penetration systems."

f000612,3449.720,3454.720,wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?
f000613,3454.720,3465.320,"These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference."
f000614,3465.320,3471.180,"Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces."
f000615,3471.180,3474.920,But now we've got a very good concept called competitive strategies.
f000616,3474.920,3477.100,We will do what we do best.
f000617,3477.100,3479.960,It's a strategy that we've been working on for a couple of years.
f000618,3479.960,3485.460,It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.

f000679,3803.880,3813.620,"I said from the beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic system at about the level that was added in 1983, that's about a billion dollars a year."
f000680,3813.620,3828.460,"But I don't know of any reputable scientist who believed that this system, at least as originally conceived could possibly work, this notion of some kind of astrodome over ourselves that could protect us from enemy attack."
f000681,3828.460,3830.920,It makes real sense.
f000682,3830.920,3839.020,"And as a matter of fact, the system that the administration is now talking about is very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983."
f000683,3839.020,3843.440,"So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces."
f000684,3843.440,3849.840,"Now, the other day, Mr. Bush said, â‰¥Well, if we continue with Star War-Star Wars-we have to cut some place.â‰¤ He hasn't told us where."
f000685,3849.840,3850.860,We know where they're cutting.

f000687,3852.460,3855.740,You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces.
f000688,3855.740,3858.680,You're cutting back on maintenance and equipment.
f000689,3858.680,3869.620,"An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel."

f000693,3881.200,3883.200,We're not making those choices.
f000694,3883.200,3895.520,"And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all."

f000699,3912.040,3922.040,But to continue to commit billions to this system makes no sense at all and I think Mr. Bush has been reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks.
f000700,3922.040,3923.520,That's-at least that's what I read.
f000701,3923.520,3925.840,Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.

f000704,3928.720,3942.020,Two questions: How do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing our nuclear forces when the Soviets are modernizing and how come you spend-willing to spend a dime on something that you consider a fantasy and a fraud.
f000705,3942.020,3944.700,Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions.
f000706,3944.700,3949.400,He is the man on conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier battle groups.
f000707,3949.400,3955.560,"The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready."
f000708,3955.560,3962.040,Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.
f000709,3962.040,3975.160,"And secondly, in terms of the cutting of the Coast Guard, the Democratic controlled Congress, so please help us with that, who cut $70 million from the Coast Guard out of the interdiction effort on narcotics."
f000710,3975.160,3975.161,(Applause)
f000711,3975.161,3977.560,He's got to get this thing more clear.

f000718,4001.380,4002.420,Let me try to give you one.
f000719,4002.420,4006.060,"Somewhere in the Middle East tonight, nine Americans are being held hostage."
n000274,4006.060,4007.200,(SILENCE)
f000720,4007.200,4021.040,"If you are commander-in-chief and Americans are held hostage, what will be more important to you, their individual fate, or the commitment that the United States Government must never negotiate with terrorists."
n000275,4021.040,4021.840,(SILENCE)
f000721,4021.840,4027.360,"And if any Americans are held hostage and you become president, to what lengths would you go to rescue them?"

f000722,4029.080,4031.800,"Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make."
n000277,4031.800,4032.520,(SILENCE)
f000723,4032.520,4037.000,"These are American citizens, we care deeply about them."

n000278,4043.760,4045.120,(SILENCE)
f000725,4045.120,4053.760,"But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever."
n000279,4053.760,4054.200,(SILENCE)
f000726,4054.200,4059.300,"Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us."
n000280,4059.300,4060.280,(SILENCE)
f000727,4060.280,4063.280,And that's the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.
f000728,4063.280,4077.040,"As a matter of fact, Mr. Bush was the Chairman of a task force on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before that decision was made and said, and rightly so, that we never ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers."
n000281,4077.040,4078.000,(SILENCE)
f000729,4078.000,4095.080,"And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know."
n000282,4095.080,4096.200,(SILENCE)
f000730,4096.200,4105.560,"So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it's an open invitation to others to do the same."
f000731,4105.560,4107.320,We've got to be tough on international terrorism.
n000283,4107.320,4107.680,(SILENCE)
f000732,4107.680,4109.520,We've got to treat it as international crime.

n000284,4113.200,4113.800,(SILENCE)
f000734,4113.800,4126.880,"We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism."
n000285,4126.880,4127.880,(SILENCE)
f000735,4127.880,4135.560,"Yes, we should make every effort to try to help those hostages come home, but it can never be because we make concessions."
f000736,4135.560,4141.820,"That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again."
f000737,4141.820,4143.400,Mr. Vice President?
n000286,4143.400,4144.480,(SILENCE)
f000738,4144.480,4147.680,I wrote the anti-terrorist report for this government.
f000739,4147.680,4151.520,It is the best anti-terrorist report written.
n000287,4151.520,4152.920,(SILENCE)
f000740,4152.920,4156.500,"Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages."

f000742,4160.480,4174.440,"Now, it's fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps, but when the president saw this state sponsored-fingerprints of Muammar Khadaffi on the loss of American life, he hit Libya."
f000743,4174.440,4177.520,And my opponent was unwilling to support that action.
f000744,4177.520,4178.480,That's not true.
f000745,4178.480,4179.280,That's not true.
f000746,4179.280,4184.320,"And since that action, terrorist action against the United States citizens have gone down."
f000747,4184.320,4185.480,That's not true.
f000748,4185.480,4189.720,And I have long ago said I supported the president on this other matter.
f000749,4189.720,4191.600,And I've said mistakes were made.
f000750,4191.600,4196.200,Clearly nobody's going to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade arms for hostages.
f000751,4196.200,4199.320,That is a very serious charge against the president.
f000752,4199.320,4202.120,The matter has been thoroughly looked into.
f000753,4202.120,4204.000,But the point is sometimes the action- (Laughter)
f000754,4204.000,4211.080,"- has to be taken by the Federal Government and when we took action, it had a favorable response."

f000757,4215.001,4222.760,"It seems perhaps a good subject, Mr. Vice President, on which to make the point that you've campaigned vigorously as part of a leadership team."
n000290,4222.760,4223.360,(SILENCE)
f000758,4223.360,4233.600,"But so far you won't tell the American people in considerable measure what advice you gave the president, including the sale of arms to Iran and what should have been done about the hostages."
f000759,4233.600,4237.840,To the best of my knowledge there's no Constitutional requirement which prevents you from doing so.

f000769,4276.860,4280.080,Is Iran talking to Iraq about peace?
f000770,4280.080,4281.760,You judge on the record.

f000776,4305.520,4311.560,"And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record."
f000777,4311.560,4316.480,And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.

f000830,4565.080,4575.540,"Do you know who J. Danforth was, he was a man who gave his life in World War II, so ridiculing a person's name is a little beneath this process."
f000831,4575.540,4576.800,And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.
f000832,4576.800,4576.801,(Applause)
f000833,4576.801,4585.440,"Well, when it comes to ridicule, George, you win a gold medal."
f000834,4585.440,4589.000,I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.
f000835,4589.000,4589.001,(Applause)
f000836,4589.001,4589.840,Just the facts.
f000837,4589.840,4599.160,But did I-did I sense a desire that maybe Lloyd Bentsen ought to be your running mate when you said there are three people on your ticket?
f000838,4599.160,4602.780,"No, I think the debate ought to be between you and Lloyd."

f000839,4603.320,4611.760,"I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency."
n000308,4611.760,4612.440,(SILENCE)
f000840,4612.440,4623.060,"I picked Lloyd Bentsen, distinguished, strong, mature, a leader in the Senate, somebody whose qualifications nobody has questioned."
f000841,4623.060,4624.600,Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.
n000309,4624.600,4625.800,(SILENCE)
f000842,4625.800,4629.320,I doubt very much that Dan Quayle was the best qualified person for that job.
f000843,4629.320,4637.560,"And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought."
f000844,4637.560,4639.340,John will ask a question of the Governor.
f000845,4639.340,4643.520,It will be the last question and then the Vice President will have a rebuttal.
n000310,4643.520,4644.000,(SILENCE)
f000846,4644.000,4646.960,"Well, Governor, you did select Lloyd Bentsen of Texas."
f000847,4646.960,4647.760,I did indeed.
f000848,4647.760,4663.960,"And you have a lot of disagreement with him on fundamental issues, including the Reagan tax cuts, aid to the rebels in Nicaragua, the death penalty, gun control."
f000849,4663.960,4664.360,Who's right?
f000850,4664.360,4664.361,(Laughter)
f000851,4664.361,4666.320,"Well, John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years."
f000852,4666.320,4667.120,I've picked a lot of people.
f000853,4667.120,4668.140,I've picked cabinets.
f000854,4668.140,4668.760,I've named judges.
n000311,4668.760,4669.800,(SILENCE)
f000855,4669.800,4675.960,I know that the people you pick make an enormous difference in your ability to govern and I set high standards.

n000312,4681.080,4682.080,(SILENCE)
f000857,4682.080,4686.000,But I didn't pick Lloyd Bentsen because he was a clone of Mike Dukakis.
n000313,4686.000,4686.960,(SILENCE)
f000858,4686.960,4692.240,"I picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong Vice President, somebody who would be an active Vice President."

f000859,4693.200,4699.520,"Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, â‰¥Mr."
f000860,4699.520,4700.800,"President, that's wrong."
f000861,4700.800,4703.880,We shouldn't do that.â‰¤ That's the kind of Vice President I want.
f000862,4703.880,4707.320,"He, himself, has said, and rightly so, that he'll be a strong Vice President."
f000863,4707.320,4710.240,"When the Vice President makes a decision, that will be his decision."
n000315,4710.240,4711.200,(SILENCE)
f000864,4711.200,4713.120,And I'm very very proud of that choice.
f000865,4713.120,4715.360,And I didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.
f000866,4715.360,4720.760,"You know, Sam Rayburn once said that if two people agree on everything then only one person is doing the thinking."

n000317,4735.280,4736.120,(SILENCE)
f000868,4736.120,4737.240,I doubt very much.

f000869,4737.840,4745.880,I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.

n000319,4751.960,4752.560,(SILENCE)
f000873,4752.560,4754.380,I believe it does meet the test.

f000875,4760.960,4760.961,(Laughter)
f000876,4760.961,4765.800,I had hoped this had been a little friendlier evening.

f000879,4774.480,4776.340,But you talk about judgment.
n000321,4776.340,4776.840,(SILENCE)
f000880,4776.840,4784.520,"I mean, what kind of judgment-I mean, jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of farm policy."
f000881,4784.520,4789.960,What kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser now in jail in Massachusetts?
f000882,4789.960,4792.800,"I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument."
f000883,4792.800,4798.520,"But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and he'll do an outstanding job."

f000884,4799.680,4802.320,"Gentlemen, I was given some bad word a moment ago."
f000885,4802.320,4805.000,There is time for one more question.
f000886,4805.000,4811.320,Getting it in my ear and Ann Groer will ask it.
n000323,4811.320,4813.640,(SILENCE)
f000887,4813.640,4814.200,Ann?
f000888,4814.200,4815.560,To the Governor.
f000889,4815.560,4836.600,"Governor Dukakis, as many U.S. farmers face or undergo foreclosure, the United States is considering the possibility of forgiving a certain percentage of debt owed by Latin American and Third World countries, do you favor giving these countries a break in their loans and, if so, how do you explain that to the American farmers who are losing their land and livelihood?"
n000324,4836.600,4838.000,(SILENCE)
f000890,4838.000,4856.760,"Well, I think we have to go to work on the problem of Third World debt and we've got to assist those Third World countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently-which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which if we don't do something about it and assist them along with other nations around the world, we'll destroy their economies, destroy their future."
f000891,4856.760,4861.120,And at the same time will destroy markets that are important to our farmers.
f000892,4861.120,4870.960,But I also believe we need an agricultural policy which doesn't cost us 15 to 20 to 25 billion dollars a year that it's been costing us over the course of the past three or four years under this administration.
f000893,4870.960,4874.280,"I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies."
f000894,4874.280,4881.960,And thanks to the Congress we now have an agricultural credit bill which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of our farmers.
f000895,4881.960,4903.940,"I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time."
f000896,4903.940,4912.880,"Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products."
f000897,4912.880,4919.020,"I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers."
f000898,4919.020,4936.320,But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.
f000899,4936.320,4949.240,"As a matter of fact, Mexico, itself, is one of our biggest agricultural customers, so in the sense that we can work to help Mexico rebuild and expand and deal with these very serious economic problems we help our farmers at the same time."
f000900,4949.240,4950.020,Mr. Vice President?
n000325,4950.020,4950.400,(SILENCE)
f000901,4950.400,4953.760,I oppose supply management and production controls.
f000902,4953.760,4959.400,"I support the farm bill, the 1985 farm bill and spending is moving in the right direction."
f000903,4959.400,4965.560,I want to expand our markets abroad and that's why I've called for that first economic summit to be on agriculture.
f000904,4965.560,4973.400,I will not go back to the way the Democrats did it and used food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in this country.
f000905,4973.400,4991.280,"I want to see rural redevelopment and I have been out front in favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol and comes from using your corn and I think we can do better in terms of biodegradable for a lot of product, so I'm optimistic about the agricultural economy."
f000906,4991.280,4994.300,"In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan."
f000907,4994.300,5001.280,"I want to see market economies spring up all around the world and to the degree they do, we are succeeding."
n000326,5001.280,5001.680,(SILENCE)
f000908,5001.680,5004.400,And I don't want to see the banks let off the hook.
f000909,5004.400,5010.960,"I would oppose that, but I think were on the right track in agriculture and I am very very encouraged."
f000910,5010.960,5020.600,"But let's not go back to that-what they call supply management and production control, that'll simply price us out of the international market."
f000911,5020.600,5022.280,Let's try to expand our markets abroad.
f000912,5022.280,5023.140,All right.
f000913,5023.140,5024.240,That really is the end.
f000914,5024.240,5026.720,"Now, let's go to closing statements."
f000915,5026.720,5030.820,They will be two minutes each in duration by agreement.
f000916,5030.820,5032.760,Vice President Bush goes first.
f000917,5032.760,5034.020,Governor Dukakis second.
f000918,5034.020,5034.880,Mr. Vice President.
n000327,5034.880,5035.240,(SILENCE)
f000919,5035.240,5048.000,I talked in New Orleans about a gentler and kinder nation and I have made specific proposals on education and the environment and on ethics and energy and how we do better in battling crime in our country.
f000920,5048.000,5052.640,But there are two main focal points of this election.
f000921,5052.640,5054.420,Opportunity and peace.
f000922,5054.420,5056.600,I want to keep this expansion going.

f000923,5057.160,5059.820,"Yes, we want change but we are the change."
f000924,5059.820,5060.960,I am the change.
f000925,5060.960,5064.460,I don't want to go back to malaise and misery index.
f000926,5064.460,5066.100,"And, so, opportunity."
f000927,5066.100,5068.100,Keep America at work.
f000928,5068.100,5072.800,The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.
f000929,5072.800,5075.740,"And in terms of peace, we are on the right track."
f000930,5075.740,5081.200,We've achieved an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never possible and I want to build on it.
n000329,5081.200,5081.560,(SILENCE)
f000931,5081.560,5090.400,I want to see us finalize that START agreement and I want it to be the one to finally lead the world to banishing chemical and biological weapons.
f000932,5090.400,5093.500,I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces.
n000330,5093.500,5094.040,(SILENCE)
f000933,5094.040,5095.840,And then it gets down to a question of values.
f000934,5095.840,5104.720,We've had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing.
f000935,5104.720,5106.220,And I do favor the death penalty.
f000936,5106.220,5108.320,And we've got a wide array of differences on those.
n000331,5108.320,5108.840,(SILENCE)
f000937,5108.840,5117.240,"But in the final analysis-in the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth, they're going to say, â‰¥Who has the values I believe in?"
n000332,5117.240,5118.200,(SILENCE)
f000938,5118.200,5123.160,Who has the experience that we trust?

f000939,5123.920,5133.720,"Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done?â‰¤ My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support."
