f000522,4398.760,4417.480,It seems to me that those who sit in Washington eighteen months after the incident are not the best judges of the decision-making process that had to be made by the National Security Council and by myself at the time the incident was developing in the Pacific.

f000538,4523.060,4534.700,"The only thing I believe is that whatever the - the knowledge was that Mr. Ford had should have been given to the American people eighteen months ago, immediately after the Mayaguez uh - incident occurred."
f000539,4534.700,4536.920,This is uh - what the American people want.

f000545,4587.560,4607.460,I believe that the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries because those businesses trade with Israel or because they have American Jews who are owners or directors in the company is an absolute disgrace.

f000552,4650.920,4653.740,But we ought to stand staunch.
f000553,4653.740,4666.400,And I think it's a disgrace that so far Mr. Ford's administration has blocked the passage of legislation that would've revealed by law every instance of the boycott and it would've prevented the boycott from continuing.

f000558,4707.400,4723.440,And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.
