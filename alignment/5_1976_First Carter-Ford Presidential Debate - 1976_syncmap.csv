f000021,126.160,133.420,"Well, one of those concerns, not an uncommon one about uh - candidates in any year, is that many voters say they don't really know where you stand."

f000024,150.780,151.480,Yes.
f000025,151.480,161.800,First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.
f000026,161.800,176.360,"This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project."

f000027,177.000,183.160,"We'll never have uh - an end to the inflationary spiral, and we'll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work."
f000028,183.160,185.600,There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done.
n000021,185.600,186.200,(SILENCE)
f000029,186.200,192.880,"First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs."
f000030,192.880,201.480,"Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh - to cooperate with government in matters like housing."
n000022,201.480,202.040,(SILENCE)
f000031,202.040,221.320,"Here a very small investment of taxpayer's money - in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh - putting forward of uh - two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the - in the construction industry."
n000023,221.320,221.920,(SILENCE)
f000032,221.920,235.160,"Another thing is to deal with our - uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don't speak English, or who're black, or young people, or - 40 percent of the employment."
f000033,235.160,248.360,Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.
f000034,248.360,263.240,"Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past."
f000035,263.240,270.920,"These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment."
n000024,270.920,271.600,(SILENCE)
f000036,271.600,286.760,"There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other."
n000025,286.760,287.160,(SILENCE)
f000037,287.160,307.480,"In a lot of places where unemployment is very high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level."
f000038,307.480,325.760,"But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh - of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh - 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about - uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget."
n000026,325.760,327.040,(SILENCE)
f000039,327.040,331.040,"Governor, uh - in the event you are successful and you do achieve a drastic drop"

f000040,331.440,341.520,"Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?"
n000028,341.520,342.520,(SILENCE)
f000041,342.520,363.040,Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.
n000029,363.040,363.680,(SILENCE)
f000042,363.680,373.200,"And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary."
f000043,373.200,381.640,I would not favor the uh - payment of uh - of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work.
n000030,381.640,382.120,(SILENCE)
f000044,382.120,394.500,But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.
n000031,394.500,395.720,(SILENCE)
f000045,395.720,397.360,"Mr. President, your response."
f000046,397.360,405.980,I don't believe that uh that Mr. Carter's been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances.
n000032,405.980,407.760,(SILENCE)
f000047,407.760,419.280,I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.
n000033,419.280,420.040,(SILENCE)
f000048,420.040,437.640,"That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh - we all know that it would've controlled our economy, it would've added uh - ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government."
f000049,437.640,452.840,"It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy."
n000034,452.840,453.560,(SILENCE)
f000050,453.560,470.240,We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh - about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion - three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector.
n000035,470.240,471.040,(SILENCE)
f000051,471.040,493.660,"We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed."
f000052,493.660,509.240,We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.
n000036,509.240,509.720,(SILENCE)
f000053,509.720,519.880,"Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh - debates, and these are the kind of programs that I'll talk about on my time."

f000055,524.840,529.720,"Mr. President, I would like to continue for a moment on this uh question of taxes which you have just raised."
n000039,529.720,530.160,(SILENCE)
f000056,530.160,537.240,You have said that you favor more tax cuts for middle-income Americans - even those earning up to $30 thousand a year.
n000040,537.240,538.840,(SILENCE)
f000057,538.840,544.360,That presumably would cost the Treasury quite a bit of money in lost revenue.
f000058,544.360,555.400,"In view of the very large budget deficits that you have accumulated and that are still in prospect, how is it possible to promise further tax cuts and to reach your goal of balancing the budget?"
n000041,555.400,556.560,(SILENCE)
f000059,556.560,569.480,"At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business."
f000060,569.480,585.000,"I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures - a one-for-one proposition."
n000042,585.000,585.680,(SILENCE)
f000061,585.680,596.980,"And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction."
n000043,596.980,598.040,(SILENCE)
f000062,598.040,613.080,"In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person."
f000063,613.080,629.300,"That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption - money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn't have to spend."
f000064,629.300,638.460,"But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can - with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction."

f000065,639.320,649.960,"In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending."

f000067,658.640,661.800,We can't afford that kind of growth in federal spending.
n000047,661.800,662.440,(SILENCE)
f000068,662.440,669.200,And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.

f000069,669.640,679.160,"With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed."
f000070,679.160,699.960,"And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy."
n000049,699.960,701.360,(SILENCE)
f000071,701.360,713.380,"Mr. President, to follow up a moment, uh - the Congress has passed a tax bill which is before you now, which did not meet exactly the uh - sort of outline that you requested."

f000074,721.480,726.080,That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established.
n000053,726.080,726.960,(SILENCE)
f000075,726.960,740.760,"I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars."
f000076,740.760,752.440,"And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget."

f000077,753.320,765.920,"I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended."
n000055,765.920,766.480,(SILENCE)
f000078,766.480,774.040,So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.

f000082,790.200,801.440,"On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad."
