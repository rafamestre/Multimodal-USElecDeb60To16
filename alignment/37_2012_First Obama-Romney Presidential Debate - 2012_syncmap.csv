f000031,239.260,251.580,"Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off."
f000032,251.580,252.940,I've got a different view.
f000033,252.940,255.000,I think we've got to invest in education and training.

f000034,255.800,277.660,"I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments."

f000053,355.160,361.360,"Not the one we've been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich."

n000027,362.280,362.800,(SILENCE)
f000055,362.800,364.980,My plan has five basic parts.
f000056,364.980,368.220,"One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent."
f000057,368.220,370.340,That creates about 4 million jobs.
f000058,370.340,374.040,"Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America."
f000059,374.040,376.000,"Crack down on China, if and when they cheat."

n000029,382.640,383.080,(SILENCE)
f000062,383.080,385.600,"Number four, get to us a balanced budget."
f000063,385.600,388.680,"Number five, champion small business."
f000064,388.680,400.960,"It's small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low."
n000030,400.960,401.320,(SILENCE)
f000065,401.320,407.920,"Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful."
f000066,407.920,421.620,"The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work."
f000067,421.620,423.500,That's not the right answer for America.
f000068,423.500,427.280,I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again.
n000031,427.280,428.240,(SILENCE)
f000069,428.240,428.940,Thank you.
f000070,428.940,437.760,"Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down -- his trick-down approach, as he said yours is."
n000032,437.760,438.600,(SILENCE)
f000071,438.600,441.200,"Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do."
n000033,441.200,441.960,(SILENCE)
f000072,441.960,456.540,"First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools."
f000073,456.540,466.200,"We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers."
f000074,466.200,478.600,"So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now."
f000075,478.600,483.100,And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.
f000076,483.100,494.040,"When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent."
f000077,494.040,501.640,But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas.
f000078,501.640,506.280,I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.
f000079,506.280,517.320,"On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years."
n000034,517.320,518.040,(SILENCE)
f000080,518.040,525.960,"But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments."
f000081,525.960,528.180,So all of this is possible.
f000082,528.180,535.000,"Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code?"
n000035,535.000,535.320,(SILENCE)
f000083,535.320,542.160,"And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?"
f000084,542.160,557.540,"And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for."
f000085,557.540,558.280,That's $8 trillion.
f000086,558.280,571.160,"How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign."
f000087,571.160,578.400,"Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we're going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can."
f000088,578.400,584.460,"But, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you'd like to ask the president directly about something he just said?"
f000089,584.460,585.120,"Well, sure."
f000090,585.120,587.200,I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.
f000091,587.200,590.040,"First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut."
f000092,590.040,593.200,I don't have a tax cut of a scale that you're talking about.
f000093,593.200,597.540,My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class.
f000094,597.540,601.040,But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people.
f000095,601.040,603.260,High-income people are doing just fine in this economy.
f000096,603.260,605.440,They'll do fine whether you're president or I am.
f000097,605.440,609.740,The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans.
f000098,609.740,612.900,"Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried."
n000036,612.900,613.440,(SILENCE)
f000099,613.440,614.800,They're just being crushed.
n000037,614.800,615.240,(SILENCE)
f000100,615.240,620.280,"Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300."
n000038,620.280,620.800,(SILENCE)
f000101,620.800,622.860,This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself.
f000102,622.860,624.740,I'll call it the economy tax.
f000103,624.740,625.640,It's been crushing.
f000104,625.640,629.200,"At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president."
f000105,629.200,630.160,Electric rates are up.
n000039,630.160,630.640,(SILENCE)
f000106,630.640,631.640,Food prices are up.
n000040,631.640,632.360,(SILENCE)
f000107,632.360,635.480,"Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family."
n000041,635.480,636.120,(SILENCE)
f000108,636.120,638.040,Middle-income families are being crushed.
n000042,638.040,638.440,(SILENCE)
f000109,638.440,640.160,And so the question is how to get them going again.
f000110,640.160,641.180,And I've described it.
f000111,641.180,646.980,"It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business."
f000112,646.980,649.360,Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan.
f000113,649.360,652.100,But the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note.
f000114,652.100,653.400,"First, education."
f000115,653.400,657.140,"I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy."
f000116,657.140,664.240,"But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies."
f000117,664.240,665.780,Overhead is overwhelming.
f000118,665.780,673.840,We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.
n000043,673.840,674.480,(SILENCE)
f000119,674.480,678.000,"The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down."
f000120,678.000,680.720,"And I do, both for corporations and for individuals."
n000044,680.720,681.400,(SILENCE)
f000121,681.400,691.800,"But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth."
f000122,691.800,693.040,"The third area, energy."
f000123,693.040,699.240,"Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up."
n000045,699.240,700.080,(SILENCE)
f000124,700.080,701.840,But not due to his policies.
f000125,701.840,703.120,In spite of his policies.
n000046,703.120,703.520,(SILENCE)
f000126,703.520,710.240,"Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land."
n000047,710.240,710.960,(SILENCE)
f000127,710.960,717.060,"On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half."
f000128,717.060,722.660,"If I'm president, I'll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska."
f000129,722.660,724.520,And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada.
n000048,724.520,724.920,(SILENCE)
f000130,724.920,726.320,"And, by the way, I like coal."
n000049,726.320,726.840,(SILENCE)
f000131,726.840,729.200,I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal.
f000132,729.200,733.020,People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies.
f000133,733.020,738.680,I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.
f000134,738.680,746.220,"And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government."
n000050,746.220,746.720,(SILENCE)
f000135,746.720,750.720,"My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit."
n000051,750.720,751.680,(SILENCE)
f000136,751.680,754.740,I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.
f000137,754.740,759.040,But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans.
n000052,759.040,759.680,(SILENCE)
f000138,759.680,764.420,"And I -- and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans."
f000139,764.420,768.000,So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate.
n000053,768.000,768.480,(SILENCE)
f000140,768.480,769.020,Mr. President?
f000141,769.020,774.380,"Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive."
f000142,774.380,781.900,"Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families."
n000054,781.900,782.800,(SILENCE)
f000143,782.800,783.860,And that's exactly what I did.
n000055,783.860,784.400,(SILENCE)

f000149,818.280,830.400,"Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military."
f000150,830.400,835.840,And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions.
f000151,835.840,844.800,"The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them."
f000152,844.800,846.740,"But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim."
f000153,846.740,847.400,All right.
f000154,847.400,863.240,"When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending."
f000155,863.240,876.880,And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families.

f000158,883.480,885.640,That's the analysis of economists who have looked at this.
f000159,885.640,902.040,"And -- and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth."
f000160,902.040,902.640,All right.
f000161,902.640,903.500,What is the difference?

n000060,926.520,927.040,(SILENCE)
f000173,927.040,934.440,So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.

f000179,954.360,954.860,All right?
f000180,954.860,959.140,I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.
f000181,959.140,964.860,"And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families."
f000182,964.860,967.280,I will lower taxes on middle-income families.

f000187,981.400,982.360,But let's get at the bottom line.
f000188,982.360,985.020,"That is, I want to bring down rates."
f000189,985.020,991.840,"I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need."

f000191,994.840,1008.080,"And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate."
f000192,1008.080,1011.780,"And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people."

f000198,1018.580,1020.860,Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?
f000199,1020.860,1025.920,"Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan."
f000200,1025.920,1032.880,"And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, ""Never mind."""
f000201,1032.880,1051.760,"And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class."

n000070,1073.920,1074.400,(SILENCE)
f000206,1074.400,1081.220,And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.

f000207,1082.080,1097.500,"But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot."
f000208,1097.500,1112.480,"And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy."
f000209,1112.480,1116.560,"And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business."

f000215,1145.460,1170.360,"And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow."

f000299,1544.240,1544.960,I understand.
f000300,1544.960,1548.780,The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth.

f000434,2109.800,2118.600,"As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time."

f000435,2119.640,2135.360,"Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem."
f000436,2135.360,2136.440,And governors are creative.
f000437,2136.440,2137.400,There's no doubt about it.
f000438,2137.400,2142.440,But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid.
f000439,2142.440,2145.780,What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.

f000443,2155.440,2157.240,So let's go through them one by one.
f000444,2157.240,2162.900,"First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year."
f000445,2162.900,2167.120,"And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years."

f000446,2167.640,2167.840,Now...

n000151,2169.640,2170.000,(SILENCE)
f000448,2170.000,2177.060,"And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world."
f000449,2177.060,2182.400,"Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives."
f000450,2182.400,2183.860,And you say Exxon and Mobil.
f000451,2183.860,2188.860,"Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth."
f000452,2188.860,2195.000,"But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table."
f000453,2195.000,2195.800,Of course it's on the table.
n000152,2195.800,2196.240,(SILENCE)
f000454,2196.240,2198.960,That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.
f000455,2198.960,2211.640,"But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1."
f000456,2211.640,2216.080,"I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right?"
f000457,2216.080,2221.940,So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.
f000458,2221.940,2225.880,"The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas."
n000153,2225.880,2226.800,(SILENCE)
f000459,2226.800,2228.600,"Look, I've been in business for 25 years."

f000460,2229.480,2231.160,I have no idea what you're talking about.

f000461,2231.600,2232.820,I maybe need to get a new accountant.
f000462,2232.820,2233.360,Let's...
f000463,2233.360,2238.200,But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.
f000464,2238.200,2238.201,(CROSSTALK)
f000465,2238.201,2242.520,What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country.
f000466,2242.520,2244.440,"And, finally, Medicaid to states?"
f000467,2244.440,2260.460,"I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best."
f000468,2260.460,2269.420,"And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that."
f000469,2269.420,2277.520,We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.
n000156,2277.520,2278.080,(SILENCE)
f000470,2278.080,2284.700,So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy.
f000471,2284.700,2291.420,Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.
f000472,2291.420,2292.760,Let states do this.
f000473,2292.760,2297.020,"And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them."
f000474,2297.020,2297.540,Let's go.
f000475,2297.540,2303.680,"But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government."
f000476,2303.680,2306.280,"(inaudible) and we're going on -- still on the economy, on another -- but another part of it..."
f000477,2306.280,2306.440,OK.
f000478,2306.440,2308.000,All right?

f000479,2308.560,2308.820,All right.

f000485,2327.760,2330.200,Social Security is structurally sound.

f000487,2336.560,2339.080,But it is -- the basic structure is sound.
n000162,2339.080,2340.400,(SILENCE)
f000488,2340.400,2351.340,"But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver of our deficits right now."
f000489,2351.340,2355.200,"You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me."
n000163,2355.200,2355.760,(SILENCE)
f000490,2355.760,2356.640,My grandparents did.
f000491,2356.640,2359.320,My grandfather died a while back.
f000492,2359.320,2362.460,My grandmother died three days before I was elected president.
f000493,2362.460,2363.620,And she was fiercely independent.
f000494,2363.620,2372.540,"She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank."
f000495,2372.540,2374.960,And she ended up living alone by choice.
n000164,2374.960,2375.600,(SILENCE)
f000496,2375.600,2380.080,And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare.
f000497,2380.080,2386.840,"She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go."
n000165,2386.840,2388.000,(SILENCE)
f000498,2388.000,2392.980,And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements.
f000499,2392.980,2397.460,"You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks."
f000500,2397.460,2402.760,"These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this."
n000166,2402.760,2403.560,(SILENCE)
f000501,2403.560,2408.880,"So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term?"
f000502,2408.880,2420.800,"And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going."
n000167,2420.800,2421.360,(SILENCE)
f000503,2421.360,2434.040,$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers.
f000504,2434.040,2448.140,"And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system."
n000168,2448.140,2448.600,(SILENCE)
f000505,2448.600,2454.880,So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs.
f000506,2454.880,2462.160,"When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future."
f000507,2462.160,2463.240,We'll follow up on this.
f000508,2463.240,2469.040,"First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements."
f000509,2469.040,2479.120,"Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse."
f000510,2479.120,2488.920,"And the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare."
n000169,2488.920,2489.600,(SILENCE)
f000511,2489.600,2493.040,"So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further."

n000172,2498.360,2499.000,(SILENCE)
f000514,2499.000,2503.320,"And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn't proposing any changes for current retirees."
f000515,2503.320,2504.620,In fact he is on Medicare.
f000516,2504.620,2506.620,On Social Security he's not.
f000517,2506.620,2513.280,"But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program."
n000173,2513.280,2513.960,(SILENCE)
f000518,2513.960,2516.880,"Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers."

f000519,2517.320,2523.060,"Actually just going to them and saying, ""We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate."""
f000520,2523.060,2525.280,That's not just going after places where there's abuse.
f000521,2525.280,2526.940,That's saying we're cutting the rates.
f000522,2526.940,2532.680,Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.

f000523,2533.360,2538.940,We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.
f000524,2538.940,2546.920,This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts.
f000525,2546.920,2554.440,I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.
f000526,2554.440,2556.260,"Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back."
f000527,2556.260,2557.860,We're going to give a better prescription program.
f000528,2557.860,2561.420,That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut.
n000176,2561.420,2562.280,(SILENCE)
f000529,2562.280,2564.360,They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade.
n000177,2564.360,2565.080,(SILENCE)
f000530,2565.080,2569.560,I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare.

f000531,2570.040,2573.780,"By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it."

f000540,2611.660,2612.380,I don't.
f000541,2612.380,2614.000,And let me explain why.

f000542,2614.640,2616.300,"Again, that's for future..."

f000547,2641.640,2651.440,"The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year."

f000696,3215.680,3216.740,That's exactly right.
f000697,3216.740,3220.240,It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had.
f000698,3220.240,3231.640,"And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was."

f000703,3241.360,3249.080,It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have.
f000704,3249.080,3252.080,It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.

f000748,3474.540,3480.640,"Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover."
f000749,3480.640,3481.540,You keep your own insurance.
f000750,3481.540,3482.600,You keep your own doctor.

f000793,3729.860,3746.920,"It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?"
n000268,3746.920,3748.240,(SILENCE)
f000794,3748.240,3753.480,Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis.
f000795,3753.480,3768.800,"One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line."
f000796,3768.800,3772.960,"Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective?"
f000797,3772.960,3775.200,And there are ways of doing it.
f000798,3775.200,3784.520,"So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average."
f000799,3784.520,3787.960,And the reason they do is because they do some smart things.
f000800,3787.960,3797.840,"They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests."

f000803,3816.920,3829.340,"Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do."
f000804,3829.340,3839.960,"And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down."
f000805,3839.960,3848.200,"And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years."
n000271,3848.200,3848.720,(SILENCE)

f000809,3856.560,3864.460,"Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something."

n000274,3870.000,3870.800,(SILENCE)
f000811,3870.800,3885.060,"But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance."
f000812,3885.060,3891.560,"In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance..."

f000815,3894.140,3896.140,Let's let the governor explain what you would do...
f000816,3896.140,3896.520,Well...
f000817,3896.520,3898.400,... if Obamacare is repealed.

f000824,3912.240,3915.300,You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.
f000825,3915.300,3925.920,"But let's come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families."
f000826,3925.920,3936.440,"And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have."

f000836,3984.840,3997.760,"We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening."
f000837,3997.760,4003.980,"Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others."
f000838,4003.980,4016.580,"But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have."
f000839,4016.580,4017.720,That's the wrong way to go.
f000840,4017.720,4022.840,The private market and individual responsibility always work best.
f000841,4022.840,4030.340,Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.

f000858,4137.680,4148.460,"And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?"

f000956,4606.800,4610.780,The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job.
f000957,4610.780,4613.100,"My own view, by the way, is I've added to that."
f000958,4613.100,4626.760,"I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice."
f000959,4626.760,4637.320,"So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student."

n000322,4665.760,4666.400,(SILENCE)
f000965,4666.400,4686.920,"So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference."
f000966,4686.920,4695.800,"You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about."

f000969,4699.040,4708.600,"But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent."

f000979,4751.840,4767.180,"When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed."
f000980,4767.180,4771.760,"So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system."

f001002,4899.480,4904.900,"The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective?"

f001005,4907.960,4916.160,"I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful."
f001006,4916.160,4919.060,I don't want to cut our commitment to education.
f001007,4919.060,4921.380,I wanted to make it more effective and efficient.

f001011,4926.680,4929.620,Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation.
f001012,4929.620,4932.800,This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.
f001013,4932.800,4936.480,It's because I care about education for all of our kids.

f001032,5007.340,5023.020,"We -- as president, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case."

f001036,5040.780,5045.760,"What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern."
f001037,5045.760,5046.320,All right.
f001038,5046.320,5050.220,And Republicans and Democrats both love America.
f001039,5050.220,5060.200,But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat.
f001040,5060.200,5061.200,I've done it before.
f001041,5061.200,5062.000,I'll do it again.

f001067,5218.160,5238.860,"And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she's gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn't lay off workers during a recession."
