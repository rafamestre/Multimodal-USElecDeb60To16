f000001,7.000,8.200,Good evening.
f000002,8.200,16.120,"And welcome to the third and last presidential debate of 2008, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates."
f000003,16.120,17.640,I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News.
n000001,17.640,18.040,(SILENCE)
f000004,18.040,19.880,The rules tonight are simple.
f000005,19.880,21.880,The subject is domestic policy.
f000006,21.880,26.660,I will divide the next hour-and-a-half into nine-minute segments.
f000007,26.660,29.220,I will ask a question at the beginning of each segment.
n000002,29.220,29.960,(SILENCE)
f000008,29.960,39.480,"Each candidate will then have two minutes to respond, and then we'll have a discussion."
f000009,39.480,44.980,I'll encourage them to ask follow-up questions of each other.
n000003,44.980,45.680,(SILENCE)
f000010,45.680,47.240,"If they do not, I will."
n000004,47.240,47.840,(SILENCE)
f000011,47.840,71.520,"The audience behind me has promised to be quiet, except at this moment, when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain."
f000012,71.520,71.560,"(APPLAUSE)  Gentlemen, welcome."
f000013,71.560,78.500,"By now, we've heard all the talking points, so let's try to tell the people tonight some things that they -- they haven't heard."
n000005,78.500,79.080,(SILENCE)
f000014,79.080,79.500,Let's get to it.
n000006,79.500,80.880,(SILENCE)
f000015,80.880,84.320,"Another very bad day on Wall Street, as both of you know."
n000007,84.320,85.120,(SILENCE)
f000016,85.120,89.760,Both of you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis.
f000017,89.760,100.240,"Senator McCain, you proposed a $52 billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains, tax breaks for seniors, write-offs for stock losses, among other things."
f000018,100.240,113.180,"Senator Obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs."
n000008,113.180,114.000,(SILENCE)
f000019,114.000,118.040,I will ask both of you: Why is your plan better than his?
n000009,118.040,118.600,(SILENCE)
f000020,118.600,120.460,"Senator McCain, you go first."
n000010,120.460,120.960,(SILENCE)
f000021,120.960,122.700,"Well, let -- let me say, Bob, thank you."
f000022,122.700,124.040,And thanks to Hofstra.
f000023,124.040,130.980,"And, by the way, our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight, so our thoughts and prayers are going with you."
f000024,130.980,133.720,"It's good to see you again, Senator Obama."
n000011,133.720,134.800,(SILENCE)
f000025,134.800,138.780,"Americans are hurting right now, and they're angry."
f000026,138.780,141.100,"They're hurting, and they're angry."
f000027,141.100,152.300,"They're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington, D.C. And they're angry, and they have every reason to be angry."
f000028,152.300,154.280,And they want this country to go in a new direction.
n000012,154.280,155.320,(SILENCE)
f000029,155.320,159.440,And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I won't repeat.
n000013,159.440,160.520,(SILENCE)
f000030,160.520,165.580,"But we also have to have a short-term fix, in my view, and long- term fixes."
f000031,165.580,168.920,Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.
n000014,168.920,169.920,(SILENCE)
f000032,169.920,185.480,The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse.
f000033,185.480,198.800,"I am convinced that, until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it, and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream, but that value will come up."
n000015,198.800,199.880,(SILENCE)
f000034,199.880,202.740,"Now, we have allocated $750 billion."
f000035,202.740,218.020,"Let's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes, 11 million homes or more, so that they can afford to pay the mortgage, stay in their home."
f000036,218.020,220.520,"Now, I know the criticism of this."
f000037,220.520,224.640,"Well, what about the citizen that stayed in their homes?"
f000038,224.640,226.340,That paid their mortgage payments?
n000016,226.340,226.960,(SILENCE)
f000039,226.960,231.760,It doesn't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor's house is abandoned.
n000017,231.760,232.760,(SILENCE)
f000040,232.760,235.060,And so we've got to reverse this.
f000041,235.060,236.740,We ought to put the homeowners first.
f000042,236.740,242.840,And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.
f000043,242.840,243.760,All right.
n000018,243.760,244.120,(SILENCE)
f000044,244.120,245.580,Senator Obama?
f000045,245.580,255.220,"Well, first of all, I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Senator McCain again, and thank you, Bob."
f000046,255.220,261.960,I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.
n000019,261.960,262.840,(SILENCE)
f000047,262.840,269.720,And the financial rescue plan that Senator McCain and I supported is an important first step.
n000020,269.720,270.080,(SILENCE)
f000048,270.080,276.120,And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.
n000021,276.120,276.760,(SILENCE)
f000049,276.760,279.380,Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process.
f000050,279.380,283.780,And I think that it's going to take some time to work itself out.
f000051,283.780,289.140,But what we haven't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class.
f000052,289.140,294.300,Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis.
f000053,294.300,297.540,So I've proposed four specific things that I think can help.
n000022,297.540,298.280,(SILENCE)
f000054,298.280,299.940,"Number one, let's focus on jobs."
f000055,299.940,308.240,I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that's creating a job right here in America.
n000023,308.240,308.880,(SILENCE)
f000056,308.880,324.300,"Number two, let's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they're experiencing a crisis."
f000057,324.300,328.680,Now Senator McCain and I agree with your idea that we've got to help homeowners.
f000058,328.680,336.720,That's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages.
f000059,336.720,347.240,"I disagree with Senator McCain in how to do it, because the way Senator McCain has designed his plan, it could be a giveaway to banks if we're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less."
f000060,347.240,349.440,And we don't want to waste taxpayer money.
f000061,349.440,354.040,And we've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working.
n000024,354.040,354.760,(SILENCE)
f000062,354.760,356.240,"Last point I want to make, though."
f000063,356.240,359.480,We've got some long-term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with.
n000025,359.480,360.320,(SILENCE)
f000064,360.320,363.040,We've got to fix our energy policy that's giving our wealth away.
n000026,363.040,363.440,(SILENCE)
f000065,363.440,368.840,We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.
n000027,368.840,369.280,(SILENCE)
f000066,369.280,369.640,All right.
f000067,369.640,371.360,Would you like to ask him a question?
n000028,371.360,371.720,(SILENCE)
f000068,371.720,372.000,No.
n000029,372.000,372.360,(SILENCE)
f000069,372.360,383.520,"I would like to mention that a couple days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber, his name is Joe Wurzelbacher."
n000030,383.520,384.440,(SILENCE)
f000070,384.440,390.760,"Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years, worked 10, 12 hours a day."
f000071,390.760,398.560,And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes.
f000072,398.560,411.320,"You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people, which Joe was trying to realize the American dream."
n000031,411.320,411.840,(SILENCE)
f000073,411.840,415.040,"Now Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich."
f000074,415.040,428.720,"Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I'll keep your taxes low and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees."
f000075,428.720,437.720,And I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income.
f000076,437.720,442.580,Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses.
n000032,442.580,443.000,(SILENCE)
f000077,443.000,445.760,That's 16 million jobs in America.
f000078,445.760,456.420,And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business.
f000079,456.420,458.120,Is that what you want to do?
f000080,458.120,458.840,That's what Joe believes.
f000081,458.840,461.000,He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.
f000082,461.000,463.960,Let me tell you what I'm actually going to do.
n000033,463.960,465.840,(SILENCE)
f000083,465.840,468.500,I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself.
n000034,468.500,469.600,(SILENCE)
f000084,469.600,474.120,"And we both want to cut taxes, the difference is who we want to cut taxes for."
n000035,474.120,474.960,(SILENCE)
f000085,474.960,485.480,"Now, Senator McCain, the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America."
n000036,485.480,486.680,(SILENCE)
f000086,486.680,492.760,"Exxon Mobil, and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks."
f000087,492.760,500.780,"What I've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent."
f000088,500.780,508.200,"If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax."
n000037,508.200,508.680,(SILENCE)
f000089,508.680,509.920,Not one dime.
f000090,509.920,514.920,"And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut."
f000091,514.920,525.640,"In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does."
n000038,525.640,526.080,(SILENCE)
f000092,526.080,536.180,"Now, the conversation I had with Joe the plumber, what I essentially said to him was, ""Five years ago, when you were in a position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then."""
f000093,536.180,546.760,"And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now."
n000039,546.760,547.320,(SILENCE)
f000094,547.320,549.160,And that requires us to make some important choices.
f000095,549.160,550.680,The last point I'll make about small businesses.
n000040,550.680,551.160,(SILENCE)
f000096,551.160,561.720,"Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $250,000, but I also want to give them additional tax breaks, because they are the drivers of the economy."
n000041,561.720,562.160,(SILENCE)
f000097,562.160,565.440,They produce the most jobs.
f000098,565.440,571.400,"You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around."
f000099,571.400,578.680,"In other words, we're going to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama, and let him spread the wealth around."
f000100,578.680,580.900,I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around.
f000101,580.900,583.400,You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around.
n000042,583.400,584.080,(SILENCE)
f000102,584.080,592.280,"The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare, let's spread the wealth around."
n000043,592.280,592.760,(SILENCE)
f000103,592.760,601.720,"I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now."
f000104,601.720,604.040,Who -- why would you want to increase anybody's taxes right now?
f000105,604.040,617.680,"Why would you want to do that, anyone, anyone in America, when we have such a tough time, when these small business people, like Joe the plumber, are going to create jobs, unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around."
f000106,617.680,618.560,I'm not going to...
f000107,618.560,619.460,OK. Can I...
f000108,619.460,620.740,We're not going to do that in my administration.
f000109,620.740,622.520,If I can answer the question.
f000110,622.520,629.980,"Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans."
f000111,629.980,638.060,"Now, it is true that my friend and supporter, Warren Buffett, for example, could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order..."
f000112,638.060,638.980,We're talking about Joe the plumber.
f000113,638.980,647.760,"... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $250,000."
n000044,647.760,648.240,(SILENCE)
f000114,648.240,667.840,"Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break."

f000117,675.800,681.240,"But ultimately, we've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody's got to do it."
f000118,681.240,682.160,Nobody likes taxes.
f000119,682.160,683.560,Let's not raise anybody's taxes.
f000120,683.560,683.600,OK?
f000121,683.600,684.760,"Well, I don't mind paying a little more."

f000137,739.420,759.380,"Both of you have said you want to reduce the deficit, but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers on both of your proposals and they say the cost of your proposals, even with the savings you claim can be made, each will add more than $200 billion to the deficit."

f000292,1434.680,1446.360,Are each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to each other's face what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other?

f000294,1450.320,1452.160,"Well, this has been a tough campaign."
f000295,1452.160,1453.940,It's been a very tough campaign.
f000296,1453.940,1466.560,"And I know from my experience in many campaigns that, if Senator Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down, and do town hall meetings, and come before the American people, we could have done at least 10 of them by now."
n000120,1466.560,1467.920,(SILENCE)
f000297,1467.920,1476.940,"When Senator Obama was first asked, he said, ""Any place, any time,"" the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do, before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas."
n000121,1476.940,1477.640,(SILENCE)
f000298,1477.640,1481.640,So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different.
f000299,1481.640,1482.740,"And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough."
n000122,1482.740,1483.440,(SILENCE)
f000300,1483.440,1487.120,And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns.

f000301,1488.000,1492.440,But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable.

n000128,1543.500,1544.120,(SILENCE)
f000309,1544.120,1552.060,And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.
n000129,1552.060,1552.600,(SILENCE)
f000310,1552.600,1552.980,And I can prove it.
f000311,1552.980,1567.320,"And, Senator Obama, when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long-shot candidate -- you didn't keep your word."

f000313,1580.160,1582.540,And that's -- that's -- that's an unfortunate part.

f000315,1587.280,1587.600,Time's up.
f000316,1587.600,1587.601,All right.
f000317,1587.601,1591.520,"Well, look, you know, I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough."
f000318,1591.520,1610.500,"I think that, if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob, your network just did a poll, showing that two-thirds of the American people think that Senator McCain is running a negative campaign versus one-third of mine."
f000319,1610.500,1615.720,"And 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative."

f000322,1619.440,1631.560,"And, now, I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply."

f000324,1643.000,1645.720,That's the stuff that campaigns should be made of.
f000325,1645.720,1667.560,"The notion, though, that because we're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up, not just from your own campaign directly, John, but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations, well, I don't mind being attacked for the next three weeks."

f000328,1682.880,1694.640,"Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject."

f000340,1759.560,1762.940,"And of course, I've been talking about the economy."

f000358,1878.080,1889.200,"And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now, and that's what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign."

f000371,1920.600,1923.000,And I've -- and we've always said that that's not appropriate.

f000378,1978.160,1984.680,But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.

f000384,2000.680,2003.820,I suspect we won't agree here tonight.
f000385,2003.820,2027.960,"What I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we're facing, if we're going to solve two wars, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, if we can -- if we're going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America, then Democrats, independents and Republicans, we're going to have to be able to work together."

f000390,2049.880,2050.380,And I think...
f000391,2050.380,2051.880,"Well, Bob, you asked me a direct question."

f000400,2089.480,2092.820,I'm going to let you respond and we'll extend this for a moment.
f000401,2092.820,2101.480,"Bob, I think it's going to be important to just -- I'll respond to these two particular allegations that Senator McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention."

f000403,2106.500,2109.420,This has been their primary focus.
f000404,2109.420,2112.260,So let's get the record straight.
f000405,2112.260,2115.480,Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago.
n000161,2115.480,2116.560,(SILENCE)
f000406,2116.560,2124.620,"Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group."

f000408,2128.000,2140.800,"Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg."
n000163,2140.800,2141.640,(SILENCE)
f000409,2141.640,2155.960,"Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper."
n000164,2155.960,2156.600,(SILENCE)
f000410,2156.600,2159.360,Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign.
f000411,2159.360,2162.840,He has never been involved in this campaign.
f000412,2162.840,2165.240,And he will not advise me in the White House.
f000413,2165.240,2166.060,So that's Mr. Ayers.
f000414,2166.060,2171.180,"Now, with respect to ACORN, ACORN is a community organization."
n000165,2171.180,2171.880,(SILENCE)
f000415,2171.880,2183.300,"Apparently what they've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks, and apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names."

f000417,2186.760,2187.560,We were not involved.
f000418,2187.560,2201.120,The only involvement I've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs.
n000168,2201.120,2201.840,(SILENCE)
f000419,2201.840,2214.280,"Now, the reason I think that it's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Senator McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling."
