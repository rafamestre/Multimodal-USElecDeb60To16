f000272,1651.320,1659.080,So I believe that we should take a different approach to this and talk about how we stand on the issues instead of trying to characterize each other's motivations.
f000273,1659.080,1661.660,I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.
f000274,1661.660,1669.180,"Well, Senator Dole, let me ask you the same question I asked the President: How do you avoid being influenced by people who contribute money and services to your campaigns?"
f000275,1669.180,1670.340,I think it's very difficult.

f000336,1903.460,1909.420,I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar.

f000341,1927.660,1936.660,And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.

f000344,1948.180,1949.680,I think we all do.
f000345,1949.680,1951.420,And I hope we can do better.
f000346,1951.420,1958.020,I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.
