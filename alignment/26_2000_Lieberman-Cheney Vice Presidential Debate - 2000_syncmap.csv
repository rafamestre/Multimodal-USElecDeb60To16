f000013,107.480,119.820,"Why do you, and you, Secretary Cheney, predict surpluses you cannot possibly guarantee to pay for your proposed programs?"
f000014,119.820,125.680,"Before I answer that very important question, let me first thank you for moderating the debate."

f000015,126.080,143.400,"Let me thank the wonderful people here at Centre College and throughout Kentucky for being such gracious hosts, and let me give a special thank you to the people of Connecticut without whose support over these last 30 years I would never have had the opportunity Al Gore has given me this year."

f000024,192.280,209.680,"I'm going to describe the plan that Al Gore and I have for keeping America's prosperity going and making sure that it benefits more of America's families, particularly the hard-working middle class families who have not yet fully benefitted from the good times we've had."

f000025,210.560,218.020,"And Bernie, I'm going to explain tonight how we're going to do all this and remain fiscally responsible."
f000026,218.020,219.340,Let me get to your question.
f000027,219.340,220.800,You have about ten seconds.
f000028,220.800,228.280,"We're not spending any more than is projected by the experts, unlike our opponents."
f000029,228.280,237.600,We're setting aside $300 billion in a reserve fund in case the projections the nonpartisan experts make aren't quite right.

f000030,238.400,245.480,"We understand that balancing the budget, keeping America out of debt is a way to keep interest rates down and the economy growing."

f000037,265.401,266.840,I promise not to sing.
f000038,266.840,267.080,Good.
f000039,267.080,275.180,I think this is an extraordinarily important decision we'll make on November 7th.
f000040,275.180,290.140,"We're really going to choose between what I consider to be an old way of governing ourselves of high levels of spending, high taxes, ever more intrusive bureaucracy or a new course, a new era, if you will."
f000041,290.140,293.660,And Governor Bush and I want to offer that new course of action.

f000042,294.720,299.100,"With respect to the surplus, Bernie, we have to make some kind of forecast."
f000043,299.100,301.860,We can't make 12-month decisions in this business.
f000044,301.860,312.040,We're talking about the kinds of fundamental changes in programs and government that are going to affect people's lives for the next 25 or 30 years.
f000045,312.040,322.080,"And while it may be a little risky in some respects from an economic standpoint to try to forecast surpluses, I think we have to make some planning assumption to proceed."
n000022,322.080,322.680,(SILENCE)
f000046,322.680,325.160,We care a great deal about the issues at stake here.
f000047,325.160,329.660,"One of the difficulties we have, frankly, for the last eight years we ignored a lot of these problems."
n000023,329.660,330.360,(SILENCE)
f000048,330.360,335.760,"We haven't moved aggressively on Social Security, on Medicare."
n000024,335.760,336.080,(SILENCE)
f000049,336.080,339.040,There are important issues out there that need to be resolved.
f000050,339.040,341.260,It's important for us to get on with that business.
f000051,341.260,345.880,That's what Governor Bush and I want to do.
f000052,345.880,346.880,You alluded to problems.
f000053,346.880,353.840,"There's no magic bullet -- Secretary Cheney, in this question to you -- no magic bullets to solve the problems of public education."
n000025,353.840,354.640,(SILENCE)
f000054,354.640,357.520,What is the next best solution?
f000055,357.520,360.280,I think public education is a solution.
f000056,360.280,367.260,"Our desire is to find ways to reform our educational system, to return it to its former glory."
f000057,367.260,372.320,"I'm a product of public schools, my family, wife and daughters all went to public schools."
f000058,372.320,376.180,We believe very much in the public school system.
f000059,376.180,380.880,"But if you look at where we are from the standpoint of the nation, recent exams."
f000060,380.880,390.660,"For example, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, an independent testing service, shows there's been no progress on reading scores in the last eight years."
f000061,390.660,392.940,Almost no progress on math.
f000062,392.940,397.800,The achievement gap between minority and non-minority students is as big as itâ€™s ever been.
f000063,397.800,405.180,"We've had a significant increase in spending for education nationwide, but it has produced almost no positive results."
f000064,405.180,406.580,That's unacceptable from our standpoint.
f000065,406.580,416.860,"If you look at it and think about it, we now have in our most disadvantaged communities, 70% of our fourth graders can't read at the basic level of understanding."
f000066,416.860,421.880,We've graduated 15 million kids from high school in the last few years who can't read at a significant level.
f000067,421.880,426.320,They are permanently sentenced to a lifetime of failure.
f000068,426.320,428.340,What we want to do is to change that.
n000026,428.340,429.040,(SILENCE)
f000069,429.040,429.820,We think we know how to do it.
f000070,429.820,431.520,Governor Bush has done it in Texas.
f000071,431.520,437.800,"We want to emphasize local control so that people here in Danville, KY decide what is best for their kids."
f000072,437.800,439.380,We want to insist on high standards.
f000073,439.380,452.100,"One of the worst things we can do is fail to establish high standards, in effect to say to a youngster because of their ethnic background or income level, we don't have the same kind of expectations from you that we have from everybody else."
f000074,452.100,452.720,We want accountability.
f000075,452.720,459.460,We have to test every child every year to know whether or not we're making progress with respect to achieving those goals and objectives.
n000027,459.460,460.240,(SILENCE)
f000076,460.240,462.120,We think it's extraordinarily important.
f000077,462.120,465.120,Probably the single most important issue in this campaign.
n000028,465.120,465.680,(SILENCE)
f000078,465.680,473.080,Governor Bush has made it clear that when he's elected this will be his number one priority as a legislative measure to submit to the Congress.
n000029,473.080,474.000,(SILENCE)
f000079,474.000,475.840,Senator.
f000080,475.840,482.060,Al Gore and I are committed to making America's public schools the best in the world.
f000081,482.060,483.880,I disagree with what my opponent has said.
f000082,483.880,486.360,A lot of progress has been made in recent years.
f000083,486.360,495.900,"Average testing scores are up and a lot of extraordinary work is being done by tens of thousands of parents, teachers and administrators all around America."
f000084,495.900,497.840,There is more to be done.
f000085,497.840,500.760,"If you'll allow me, I want to go back to your last question."
f000086,500.760,501.900,It leads to this question.
n000030,501.900,502.320,(SILENCE)
f000087,502.320,512.920,"I think both of us agree that leaving aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses, there's $1.8 trillion in surplus available to spend over the next ten years."
f000088,512.920,515.660,As I said before we're being fiscally responsible about it.
f000089,515.660,519.280,We're taking $300 billion off the top to put in reserve fund.
n000031,519.280,519.960,(SILENCE)
f000090,519.960,525.760,The rest we'll use for middle class tax cuts and invest in programs like education.
n000032,525.760,526.280,(SILENCE)
f000091,526.280,528.540,There's a big difference between these two tickets.
f000092,528.540,540.120,Our opponents are going to spend $1.6 trillion of the $1.8 trillion surplus projected on that big tax cut that Al Gore talked about the other night so effectively.
n000033,540.120,540.920,(SILENCE)
f000093,540.920,543.500,We're saving money to invest in education.
f000094,543.500,547.960,You cannot reform education and improve it in this country without spending some money.
n000034,547.960,548.760,(SILENCE)
f000095,548.760,553.240,Al Gore and I have committed $170 billion for that purpose.
n000035,553.240,553.720,(SILENCE)
f000096,553.720,558.640,"To recruit 100,000 new teachers to reduce the size of classrooms."
n000036,558.640,559.120,(SILENCE)
f000097,559.120,564.960,To help local school districts build new buildings so our children are not learning in crumbling classrooms.
n000037,564.960,565.640,(SILENCE)
f000098,565.640,569.600,And we're not just going to stop at high school.
f000099,569.600,579.220,"We're going to go on and give the middle class the ability to deduct up to $10,000 a year in the cost of college tuition."
f000100,579.220,592.480,"Now, that is a tremendous life-saving change which will help people carry on their education and allow them to develop the kinds of skills that will help them succeed in the hi-tech economy of today."
f000101,592.480,597.340,"This is a very important issue, Bernie."
n000038,597.340,598.080,(SILENCE)
f000102,598.080,602.820,Maybe we could extend on education for a moment.
f000103,602.820,606.140,You're asking me to invoke the moderator's discussion?
f000104,606.140,606.400,Yes.
f000105,606.400,607.400,It is so granted.
f000106,607.400,609.940,"Thank you, sir."
f000107,609.940,612.400,"Your honor, do I have a chance to respond?"
f000108,612.400,613.280,Of course you do.
f000109,613.280,617.820,The secretary will have two minutes and then you'll have two minutes.
n000039,617.820,618.400,(SILENCE)
f000110,618.400,625.160,"Letâ€™s talk about this question of the surplus because it drives a lot of what we're talking about here, Joe."
f000111,625.160,633.920,"If you look at our proposal, we take half of the projected surplus and set it aside for Social Security."
f000112,633.920,636.140,Over $2.4 trillion.
f000113,636.140,646.940,"We take roughly a fourth of it for other urgent priorities such as Medicare reform and education, several of these other key programs we want to support."
f000114,646.940,653.640,And we take roughly one-fourth of it and return it in the form of a tax cut to the American taxpayer.
f000115,653.640,656.840,We think it's extraordinarily important to do that.
f000116,656.840,659.840,It is a fundamental difference between our two approaches.
f000117,659.840,677.120,"If you look, frankly, by our numbers and the numbers of the Senate Budget Committee, which has totaled up all the promises that Vice President Gore has made during the course of the campaign, they are some $900 billion in spending over and above that surplus already and we still have a month to go in the campaign."
n000040,677.120,677.920,(SILENCE)
f000118,677.920,684.120,The fact is that the program that we put together we think is very responsible.
f000119,684.120,687.680,Suggestion that somehow all of it is going for tax cuts isn't true.
f000120,687.680,691.980,Another way to look at it is over the course of the next ten years we'll collect roughly $25 trillion in revenue.
f000121,691.980,699.060,We want to take about 5% of that and return that to the American taxpayer in the form of tax relief.
n000041,699.060,699.920,(SILENCE)
f000122,699.920,704.500,We have the highest level of taxation now we've had since World War II.

n000042,708.040,708.840,(SILENCE)
f000124,708.840,719.180,"We think it is appropriate to return to the American people so that they can make choices themselves in how that money ought to be spent; whether on education, retirement or on paying their bills."
f000125,719.180,720.960,It is their choice and it is their prerogative.
n000043,720.960,721.640,(SILENCE)
f000126,721.640,731.600,We want to give them the opportunity to make those kinds of choices for themselves and we think this is a totally reasonable approach.
f000127,731.600,732.240,Senator?
f000128,732.240,734.200,Let me start with the numbers.
f000129,734.200,742.600,"With all due respect, the Senate Budget Committee estimates that Dick Cheney has just referred to are the estimates of the partisan Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee."
n000044,742.600,743.280,(SILENCE)
f000130,743.280,748.520,We're using the numbers presented by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
n000045,748.520,749.040,(SILENCE)
f000131,749.040,757.000,We start with an agreement which is this surplus in the Social Security fund should be locked up and used for Social Security.
n000046,757.000,758.040,(SILENCE)
f000132,758.040,759.500,That's where the agreement ends.
f000133,759.500,771.480,We also agree and believe and pledge that the surplus in the Medicare trust fund should also be locked up with a sign on it that says â€œpoliticians keep your hands off.â€ Our opponents do not do that.
f000134,771.480,780.680,"In fact, they raid the Medicare trust fund to pay for, well, their tax cut and other programs that they can't afford because they've spent so much on the tax cut."
n000047,780.680,781.280,(SILENCE)
f000135,781.280,786.780,Let me come back to the remaining $1.8 trillion that we both talked about.
f000136,786.780,795.900,"The numbers show that $1.6 trillion goes to the big tax cut which, as Al Gore said the other night, sends 43% to the top 1%."
f000137,795.900,812.640,"Worse than that, when you add on the other spending programs that our opponents have committed to, plus the cost of their plan to privatize Social Security, by our calculations they're $1.1 trillion in debt."
f000138,812.640,821.820,"That means we go back down the road to higher interest rates, to higher unemployment, to a kind of self-tax increase on every American family."
f000139,821.820,829.580,"Because when interest rates go up, so, too, do the cost of mortgage payments, car payments, student loans, credit card transactions."
f000140,829.580,841.440,"So if we've learned anything over the last eight years, it is that one of the most important things the government can do, the federal government, probably the most important, is to be fiscally responsible."
n000048,841.440,842.040,(SILENCE)
f000141,842.040,846.760,And that's why Al Gore and I are committed to balancing the budget every year.

f000142,847.120,857.040,"In fact, the paying off the debt by the year 2012, when by our calculation our opponent's economic plan still leaves America $2.8 trillion in debt."

f000608,3983.660,3986.100,That was a bipartisan act that was adopted.
f000609,3986.100,3994.620,The Anti-Crime Act that has helped to lower crime more than 20% in our country was also bipartisan.
f000610,3994.620,4007.920,"The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which was critical to getting our economy to the point and our government to the point of unprecedented surplus we enjoy today also was bipartisan, and Al Gore was involved."
f000611,4007.920,4015.120,I would say that's exactly the kind of bipartisan leadership that he and I can bring to Washington to get things done.
f000612,4015.120,4022.500,"With all due respect, Joe, there's an awful lot of evidence that there hasn't been any bipartisan leadership out of this administration or Al Gore."

f000713,4638.960,4640.800,We forgive you.
f000714,4640.800,4641.240,Thank you.
f000715,4641.240,4645.340,"You're human, like we are."

f000716,4646.760,4647.700,Mr. Secretary.
f000717,4647.700,4661.760,"Vice President of the United States of America, what would you bring to the job that you're opponent wouldn't?"
f000718,4661.760,4665.080,We clearly come from different political perspectives.
f000719,4665.080,4672.960,"Joe is a Democrat from New England, I'm a Republican from the west, from Wyoming."
f000720,4672.960,4676.320,And I think that weighs into it to some extent.
f000721,4676.320,4682.440,Clearly we're both in the positions we're in because of our personal relationships with our principals.
n000209,4682.440,4683.240,(SILENCE)
f000722,4683.240,4690.500,I think the areas that I would bring are the things that Governor Bush emphasized when he picked me.
f000723,4690.500,4694.280,That I have been White House Chief of Staff and ran the White House under President Ford.
f000724,4694.280,4697.400,"Spent ten years in the House, eight of that in the leadership."
n000210,4697.400,4698.000,(SILENCE)
f000725,4698.000,4705.040,"Served as Secretary of Defense, and then had significant experience in the private sector."

f000726,4706.080,4720.180,"I think that where there are differences between Joe and myself in terms of background and experience, I clearly have spent a lot of time in executive positions running large organizations both in private business as well as in government."
f000727,4720.180,4730.840,And that is a set of qualifications that Governor Bush found attractive when he selected me.
f000728,4730.840,4731.680,I'll leave it at that.
f000729,4731.680,4731.840,Senator?
f000730,4731.840,4733.540,I have great respect for Dick Cheney.
f000731,4733.540,4736.800,I don't agree with a lot of things he said in this campaign.
f000732,4736.800,4738.560,But I have a lot of respect for him.
f000733,4738.560,4746.240,"He was a very distinguished Secretary of Defense, and I don't have anything negative to say about him."
f000734,4746.240,4757.880,I want to say with the humility that is required to respond to this statement that I think what I would bring to the office of the vice presidency is a lifetimeâ€™s experience.
n000212,4757.880,4758.400,(SILENCE)
f000735,4758.400,4774.880,"Growing up in a working class family, having the opportunity to go to a great public school system, then to go on to college and then to be drawn really by President Kennedy, as well as the values of service my family gave me, into public life."
f000736,4774.880,4776.120,Wanting to make a difference.
f000737,4776.120,4791.040,"I have had extraordinary opportunities, thanks again to those folks back home in Connecticut, Â as a state senator, attorney general trying to enforce the law to protect them and the environment and consumers, and to litigate on behalf of humans rights."
f000738,4791.040,4802.840,"And for the last 12 years as a member of the Senate of the United States focusing on national security questions, environmental protection, economic growth and values."
n000213,4802.840,4803.320,(SILENCE)
f000739,4803.320,4812.440,But perhaps what I most bring is a friendship and shared values and shared priorities with Al Gore.
n000214,4812.440,4812.920,(SILENCE)
f000740,4812.920,4815.280,I have tremendous respect for Al Gore.
f000741,4815.280,4817.480,I've known him for 15 years.
f000742,4817.480,4822.760,He's an outstanding person as a public official and as a private person.
f000743,4822.760,4825.540,His life is built on his faith.
f000744,4825.540,4828.300,It's devoted to his family.
f000745,4828.300,4831.720,He volunteered for service in Vietnam from the beginning.
f000746,4831.720,4836.400,In Congress he's been willing to take on the big interests and fight for average people.
f000747,4836.400,4854.140,As vice president I think he's been the most effective vice president in the history of the United States and he has the right program to use the prosperity all the American people have earned to help particularly hard working middle-class families raise up their children to enjoy a better life.
f000748,4854.140,4860.340,"I think that's what this is all about, why I'm so proud to be his running mate."
f000749,4860.340,4865.320,And because of my boo-boo I'm going to direct this question again to Secretary Cheney.
n000215,4865.320,4865.720,(SILENCE)
f000750,4865.720,4876.680,Have you noticed a contradiction or hypocritical shift by your opponent on positions and issues since he was nominated?

f000752,4884.760,4886.600,"Thanks, Bernie."
f000753,4886.600,4895.520,I do have a couple of concerns where I like the old Joe Lieberman better than I do the new Joe Lieberman.
f000754,4895.520,4898.520,Let's see if I can put them in those terms.
f000755,4898.520,4905.720,"Joe established an outstanding record, I thought, in his work on this whole question of violence in the media."
n000217,4905.720,4906.600,(SILENCE)
f000756,4906.600,4911.000,And the kinds of materials that were being peddled to our children.
f000757,4911.000,4914.280,And many of us on the Republican side admired him for that.
n000218,4914.280,4915.080,(SILENCE)
f000758,4915.080,4928.800,"There is, I must say, the view now that having joined with Al Gore on the ticket on the other side, that the depth of conviction that we had admired before isn't quite as strong as it was, perhaps, in the past."
n000219,4928.800,4929.520,(SILENCE)
f000759,4929.520,4957.320,"The temptation on the one hand to criticize the activities of the industry, as was pointed out recently in the Federal Trade Commission where they're taking clearly material meant for adults and selling it to our children, while at the same time they are participating in fundraising events with some of the people responsible for that activity has been a source of concern for many of us."
f000760,4957.320,4967.400,"We were especially disturbed, Joe, at a recent fundraiser you attended where there was a comedian that got up and criticized George Bush's religion."
f000761,4967.400,4974.580,I know you're not responsible for having uttered any words of criticism of his religion.
f000762,4974.580,4981.040,"My concern would be, frankly, that you haven't been as -- as consistent as you had been in the past."
f000763,4981.040,4992.720,That a lot of your good friends like Bill Bennett and others of us who had admired your firmness of purpose over the years have felt that you're not quite the crusader for that cause that you once were.
n000220,4992.720,4994.360,(SILENCE)
f000764,4994.360,4997.460,"Bernie, you'll not be surprised to hear that I disagree."
f000765,4997.460,5004.080,First let me talk about that joke about religion which I found very distasteful.
f000766,5004.080,5019.700,"And believe me, if anybody has devoted his life to respecting the role of religion in American life and understands that Americans from the beginning of our history have turned to God for strength and purpose, it's me."
f000767,5019.700,5024.080,"And any offense that was done, I apologize for."
f000768,5024.080,5025.760,I thought that humor was unacceptable.
f000769,5025.760,5030.640,Let me come to the question of Hollywood and then answer the general question.
n000221,5030.640,5031.040,(SILENCE)
f000770,5031.040,5052.400,"Al Gore and I have felt for a long time, first as parents and then only second as public officials, that we cannot let America's parents stand alone in this competition that they feel they're in with Hollywood to raise their own kids and give their kids the faith and values they want to give them."
f000771,5052.400,5055.480,I've been a consistent crusader on that behalf.
f000772,5055.480,5069.700,John McCain and I actually requested the Federal Trade Commission report that came out three or four weeks ago which proved conclusively that the entertainment industry was marketing adult-rated products to our children.
f000773,5069.700,5071.480,That is just not acceptable.
f000774,5071.480,5079.860,One finding was that they were actually using 10 to 12-year-olds to test screen adult-rated products.
f000775,5079.860,5086.340,"When that report came out, Al Gore and I said to the entertainment industry, stop it."
f000776,5086.340,5090.860,"If you don't stop it in six months, we'll ask the Federal Trade Commission to take action against you."
f000777,5090.860,5093.400,There was no similar strong response from our opponents.
f000778,5093.400,5096.820,We repeated that message when we went to Los Angeles.
f000779,5096.820,5098.280,I repeat it today.
f000780,5098.280,5107.100,We won't stop until the entertainment industry stops marketing its products to our children.
f000781,5107.100,5108.800,Al Gore and I -- I'm out.
f000782,5108.800,5111.800,Maybe I can come back to it.
f000783,5111.800,5112.200,Please continue.
f000784,5112.200,5113.500,You have about ten seconds.
f000785,5113.500,5119.160,"Al Gore and I agree on most everything, but we disagree on some things."
f000786,5119.160,5126.020,"But he said to me, be yourself, thatâ€™s why I chose you, don't change a single position you have."
f000787,5126.020,5132.000,And I have not changed a single position since Al Gore nominated me to be his vice president.

f000790,5142.680,5144.440,That went very quickly.

f000792,5148.200,5153.540,I'm told tens of millions of people have been watching this debate tonight.
f000793,5153.540,5161.760,"I must say, I wish one more person were here to watch and that is my dad, who died 15 years ago."
f000794,5161.760,5174.440,"If my dad were here, I would have the opportunity to tell him that he was right when he taught me that in America, if you have faith, work hard and play by the rules, there is nothing you cannot achieve."

f000795,5175.040,5185.240,And here I am even the son of a man who started working the night shift on a bakery truck can end up being a candidate for Vice President of the United States.
n000225,5185.240,5185.720,(SILENCE)
f000796,5185.720,5192.180,"That says a lot about the character of this nation and the goodness of you, the American people."
f000797,5192.180,5207.440,"I will tell you that Hadassah and I have traveled around this country in the last couple of months and met thousands and thousands of parents just like our moms and dads, hard working middle-class people paying their taxes, doing the jobs to keep the country running."
n000226,5207.440,5207.920,(SILENCE)
f000798,5207.920,5213.700,Trying so hard to teach their kids right from wrong and believing in their hearts that their kids can make it.
f000799,5213.700,5214.800,I agree with them.
n000227,5214.800,5215.360,(SILENCE)
f000800,5215.360,5221.740,"But to make it they need a leader who will stand up and fight for them for good education, the best education in the world."
f000801,5221.740,5227.860,"For a sound retirement system, for prescription drug benefits for their parents."
f000802,5227.860,5231.840,"And for a government that is fiscally responsible, balances the budget."
f000803,5231.840,5239.300,Keeps interest rates down so they can afford to buy a home or send their kids to college.
f000804,5239.300,5244.080,To me Al Gore is that leader and will be that kind of president.
n000228,5244.080,5244.760,(SILENCE)
f000805,5244.760,5251.660,"You know, for 224 years Americans have dreamed bigger dreams and tried bolder solutions than any other people on earth."

f000811,5274.280,5275.680,I've enjoyed the debate this evening.
f000812,5275.680,5283.880,"And thank the folks here at the Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, theyâ€™ve done a tremendous job of making this possible."
f000813,5283.880,5287.080,This is a very important decision you're going to make on November 7.
f000814,5287.080,5297.800,"We have a fundamental choice between whether or not we continue with our old ways of big government, high taxes and ever more intrusive bureaucracy, or whether we take a new course for a new era."
f000815,5297.800,5300.800,Governor Bush and I want to pursue the new course.

f000816,5301.760,5318.440,"We want to reform the Social Security system to guarantee benefits will be there for our retired folks, as well as make it possible for our young people to invest a portion of their payroll tax into a retirement account that they'll control and give them greater control over their own lives."
f000817,5318.440,5329.400,"We want to reform the Medicare system to make certain the benefits are there for our senior citizens, but also to provide prescription drug coverage for them and give them a range of choices in terms of the kind of insurance we have."

f000820,5345.880,5347.460,We also want to reform the tax code.

f000826,5366.500,5368.320,The trends are in the wrong direction.
f000827,5368.320,5373.620,The finest men and women in uniform that you'll find anyplace in the world but they deserve our support.
