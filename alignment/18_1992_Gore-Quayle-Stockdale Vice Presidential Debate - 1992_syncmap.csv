f000003,21.260,25.500,I'm Hal Bruno from ABC News and I'm going to be moderating tonight's debate.

f000007,53.840,58.800,"(APPLAUSE)  Now, the ground rules for tonight's debate."
f000008,58.800,66.160,Each candidate will have 2 minutes for an opening statement.
n000001,66.160,66.560,(SILENCE)
f000009,66.560,69.160,I will then present the issues to be discussed.

f000010,69.720,74.520,"For each topic, the candidates will have a minute and 15 seconds to respond."
f000011,74.520,80.860,Then this will be followed by a 5 minute discussion period in which they can ask questions of each other if they so choose.
f000012,80.860,86.200,"Now, the order of response has been determined by a drawing and we'll rotate with each topic."
f000013,86.200,91.280,"At the end of the debate, each candidate will have 2 minutes for a closing statement."
f000014,91.280,98.460,Our radio and TV audience should know that the candidates were given an equal allocation of auditorium seats for their supporters.
n000003,98.460,98.880,(SILENCE)
f000015,98.880,108.900,So I'd like to ask the audience here in the theater to please refrain from applause or any partisan demonstration once the debate is under way because it takes time away from the candidates.
f000016,108.900,112.360,So with that plea from your moderator let's get started.
f000017,112.360,115.740,And we'll turn first to Senator Gore for his opening statement.
n000004,115.740,116.400,(SILENCE)
f000018,116.400,117.480,Good evening.
f000019,117.480,126.460,It's great to be here in Atlanta for this debate where America will be showcased to the world when the 1996 Olympics are put on right here.
n000005,126.460,127.000,(SILENCE)
f000020,127.000,134.840,"It's appropriate because in a real sense, our discussion this evening will be about what kind of nation we want to be 4 years from now."

f000024,151.240,161.280,"And Mr. Vice President -- Dan, if I may -- it was 16 years ago that you and I went to the Congress on the very first day together."

f000025,162.120,163.360,I'll make you a deal this evening.

f000026,164.040,170.120,"If you don't try to compare George Bush to Harry Truman, I won't compare you to Jack Kennedy."

f000030,178.960,192.840,"Harry Truman, it's worth remembering, assumed the presidency when Franklin Roosevelt died here in Georgia -- only one of many occasions when fate thrust a vice president into the Oval Office in a time of crisis."
n000013,192.840,193.640,(SILENCE)
f000031,193.640,195.920,It's something to think about during the debate this evening.
n000014,195.920,196.800,(SILENCE)
f000032,196.800,200.120,But our real discussion is going to be about change.
n000015,200.120,200.720,(SILENCE)
f000033,200.720,209.200,Bill Clinton and I stand for change because we don't believe our nation can stand 4 more years of what we've had under George Bush and Dan Quayle.
f000034,209.200,221.920,"When the recession came they were like a deer caught in the headlights -- paralyzed into inaction, blinded to the suffering and pain of bankruptcies and people who were unemployed."
f000035,221.920,226.640,"We have an environmental crisis, a health insurance crisis, substandard education."
n000016,226.640,227.080,(SILENCE)

f000039,242.460,248.960,"Well, thank you, Senator Gore, for reminding me about my performance in the 1988 vice presidential debate."
n000018,248.960,249.720,(SILENCE)
f000040,249.720,254.040,"This is 1992, Bill Clinton is running against President George Bush."
n000019,254.040,254.640,(SILENCE)
f000041,254.640,280.360,"There are 2 things that I'm going to stress during this debate: one, Bill Clinton's economic plan and his agenda will make matters much, much worse -- he will raise your taxes, he will increase spending, he will make government bigger, jobs will be lost; second, Bill Clinton does not have the strength nor the character to be president of the US."
f000042,280.360,282.640,(APPLAUSE)  Let us look at the agendas.
f000043,282.640,288.320,"President Bush wants to hold the line on taxes, Bill Clinton wants to raise taxes."

f000047,301.520,304.520,"Bill Clinton wants to empower government, we want to empower people."
n000024,304.520,305.880,(SILENCE)
f000048,305.880,311.600,"In St. Louis, Missouri, in June of this year, Bill Clinton said this: ""America is the mockery of the world."""

f000065,379.360,380.680,I was there the day it started.

n000043,425.600,426.360,(SILENCE)
f000072,426.360,428.440,And that's important.
f000073,428.440,430.040,That's one thing I'm an insider on.
n000044,430.040,433.760,(SILENCE)
f000074,433.760,440.720,I was the leader of the underground of the American pilots who were shot down in prison in North Vietnam.

f000079,488.840,490.820,"Thank you, Admiral."
f000080,490.820,497.440,"I thought since you're running for vice president, that we ought to start off by talking about the vice presidency itself."
n000050,497.440,498.320,(SILENCE)
f000081,498.320,507.280,"The vice president presides over the Senate, he casts a deciding vote in case of a tie, but his role really depends on the assignments that are given to him by the president."
f000082,507.280,520.000,"However, if a president should die in office, or is unable to serve for any other reason, the vice president automatically becomes president, and that has happened 5 times in this century."

f000084,524.280,533.440,"What role would each of you like to play as vice president, what areas interest you, and what are your qualifications to serve as president, if necessary?"
f000085,533.440,541.920,"In the case of Vice President Quayle, who we're starting with, I suppose you'd tell us the role that you did play in the first term and which you'd like to do in a 2nd term."
f000086,541.920,542.560,"Go ahead, sir."
f000087,542.560,545.080,"Well, then I won't give you that answer."
f000088,545.080,545.640,Qualifications.
f000089,545.640,547.500,"I've been there, Hal."

n000055,560.120,560.840,(SILENCE)
f000096,560.840,572.760,"But even as vice president you never know exactly what your role is going to be from time to time, and let me just give you an example of where I was tested under fire and in a crisis."
n000056,572.760,573.360,(SILENCE)
f000097,573.360,578.180,President Bush was flying to Malta in 1989 to meet with President Gorbachev.
f000098,578.180,580.400,It was the first meeting between President Bush and President Gorbachev.
f000099,580.400,582.640,They had known each other before.
n000057,582.640,583.480,(SILENCE)

n000062,602.720,603.080,(SILENCE)
f000107,603.080,612.560,"And I'll tell you one other thing that qualifies you for being president -- and it's this, Hal -- you've got to stand up for what you believe in."
f000108,612.560,622.480,And nobody has ever criticized me for not having strong beliefs.
f000109,622.480,622.481,(APPLAUSE.)
f000110,622.481,623.320,Admiral Stockdale.
f000111,623.320,633.260,"My association with Mr. Perot is a very personal one and as I have stood in and finally taken his running mate position, he has granted me total autonomy."
f000112,633.260,651.800,"I don't take advantage of it, but I am sure that he would make me a partner in decision, in making decisions about the way to handle health care, the way to get this economy back on its feet again, in every way."

f000122,728.200,736.160,But the teamwork and partnership beforehand -- and hopefully that situation never happens -- how you work together is critically important.

f000129,765.000,768.200,"All right, now we have 5 minutes for discussion."
f000130,768.200,770.120,"Go ahead, Vice President Quayle."
f000131,770.120,775.620,"The answer to that is very simple: we are not going to raise taxes to create new jobs, we have a plan to create new jobs."
f000132,775.620,777.440,But that wasn't the question.
f000133,777.440,778.820,The question dealt with qualifications.
f000134,778.820,787.440,"Teamwork and partnership may be fine in the Congress, Senator Gore -- that's what Congress is all about, compromise, teamwork, working things out."
f000135,787.440,795.640,"But when you're president of the US or when you're vice president and you have to fill in like I did the night of the crisis in the Philippines, you've got to make a decision, you've got to make up your mind."

f000438,2256.960,2261.460,But you'll have a chance -- I can see what's happening here: we throw out the topic and then we drift.
