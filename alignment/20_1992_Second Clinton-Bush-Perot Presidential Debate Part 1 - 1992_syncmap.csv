HEAD,0.000,7.000,
f000001,7.000,16.220,Good evening and welcome to this second of three presidential debates between the major candidates for president of the US.
n000001,16.220,16.720,(SILENCE)
f000002,16.720,28.160,"The candidates are the Republican nominee, President George Bush, the independent Ross Perot and Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee."
f000003,28.160,37.660,"My name is Carole Simpson, and I will be the moderator for tonight's 90-minute debate, which is coming to you from the campus of the University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia."
n000002,37.660,38.520,(SILENCE)
f000004,38.520,42.960,"Now, tonight's program is unlike any other presidential debate in history."
f000005,42.960,46.280,We're making history now and it's pretty exciting.
f000006,46.280,53.080,An independent polling firm has selected an audience of 209 uncommitted voters from this area.
f000007,53.080,62.600,The candidates will be asked questions by these voters on a topic of their choosing -- anything they want to ask about.
f000008,62.600,78.160,"My job as moderator is to, you know, take care of the questioning, ask questions myself if I think there needs to be continuity and balance, and sometimes I might ask the candidates to respond to what another candidate may have said."
f000009,78.160,89.720,"Now, the format has been agreed to by representatives of both the Republican and Democratic campaigns, and there is no subject matter that is restricted."
f000010,89.720,91.160,Anything goes.
f000011,91.160,92.340,We can ask anything.
n000003,92.340,93.440,(SILENCE)
f000012,93.440,99.240,"After the debate, the candidates will have an opportunity to make a closing statement."
f000013,99.240,103.580,"So, President Bush, I think you said it earlier -- let's get it on."
f000014,103.580,104.080,Let's go.
f000015,104.080,107.160,And I think the first question is over here.
f000016,107.160,109.580,Yes.
f000017,109.580,111.640,I'd like to direct my question to Mr. Perot.
n000004,111.640,112.400,(SILENCE)
f000018,112.400,125.280,What will you do as president to open foreign markets to fair competition from American business and to stop unfair competition here at home from foreign countries so that we can bring jobs back to the US?
f000019,125.280,129.380,That's right at the top of my agenda.
f000020,129.380,148.800,"We've shipped millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out."
f000021,148.800,159.040,"Now, if you just want to get down to brass tacks, first thing you ought to do is get all these folks who've got these 1-way trade agreements that we've negotiated over the years and say fellas, we'll take the same deal we gave you."
n000005,159.040,160.400,(SILENCE)
f000022,160.400,174.120,"And they'll gridlock right at that point because for example, we've got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply -- you see, if it was a 2-way street, just couldn't do it."
f000023,174.120,176.620,We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.
n000006,176.620,177.920,(SILENCE)
f000024,177.920,181.560,To those of you in the audience who are business people: pretty simple.
n000007,181.560,182.000,(SILENCE)
f000025,182.000,192.440,"If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for a factory worker, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire a young -- let's assume you've been in business for a long time."
f000026,192.440,194.080,You've got a mature workforce.
f000027,194.080,200.120,"Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that's the most expensive single element in making the car."
n000008,200.120,200.640,(SILENCE)
f000028,200.640,204.640,"Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement."
n000009,204.640,206.240,(SILENCE)
f000029,206.240,208.520,And you don't care about anything but making money.
n000010,208.520,209.000,(SILENCE)
f000030,209.000,214.100,There will be a job-sucking sound going south.
f000031,214.100,220.060,If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.
n000011,220.060,221.200,(SILENCE)
f000032,221.200,222.600,One last point here.
f000033,222.600,231.500,"I decided I was dumb and didn't understand it so I called a ""Who's Who"" of the folks that have been around it, and I said why won't everybody go south; they said it will be disruptive; I said for how long."
f000034,231.500,233.540,I finally got 'em for 12 to 15 years.
f000035,233.540,235.840,"And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?"
f000036,235.840,244.380,"And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour; then it's leveled again, but in the meantime you've wrecked the country with these kind of deals."
f000037,244.380,246.420,We got to cut it out.
f000038,246.420,247.400,"Thank you, Mr. Perot."
f000039,247.400,252.100,"I see that the president has stood up, so he must have something to say about this."
f000040,252.100,261.560,"Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I'm trying to do is increase our exports."
n000012,261.560,262.120,(SILENCE)
f000041,262.120,268.280,"And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven't done that."
n000013,268.280,268.720,(SILENCE)
f000042,268.720,286.800,"And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the prime minister of Canada, I might add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas."
f000043,286.800,290.640,"That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many."
n000014,290.640,291.080,(SILENCE)
f000044,291.080,294.440,"But any one that's here, we want to have more jobs here."
f000045,294.440,297.540,And the way to do that is to increase our exports.
n000015,297.540,297.960,(SILENCE)
f000046,297.960,299.240,Some believe in protection.
n000016,299.240,299.880,(SILENCE)
f000047,299.880,304.720,"I don't; I believe in free and fair trade, and that's the thing that saved us."
f000048,304.720,316.160,"So I will keep on as president trying to get a successful conclusion to the GATT Round, the big Uruguay Round of trade which will really open up markets for our agriculture particularly."
f000049,316.160,320.320,I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.
f000050,320.320,325.420,I want to get one with Eastern Europe; I want to get one with Chile.
f000051,325.420,329.400,"And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection."
n000017,329.400,329.840,(SILENCE)
f000052,329.840,336.140,"And, as I say, we've had tough economic times, and it's exports that have saved us, exports that have built."
n000018,336.140,336.840,(SILENCE)
f000053,336.840,337.480,Governor Clinton.
n000019,337.480,338.880,(SILENCE)
f000054,338.880,351.960,"I'd like to answer the question, because I've actually been a governor for 12 years, so I've known a lot of people who have lost their jobs because of jobs moving overseas, and I know a lot of people whose plants have been strengthened by increasing exports."
n000020,351.960,352.680,(SILENCE)
f000055,352.680,359.000,The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.
f000056,359.000,368.280,"It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan."
n000021,368.280,369.080,(SILENCE)
f000057,369.080,370.000,So what is the answer?
f000058,370.000,371.740,Let me just mention three things very quickly.
f000059,371.740,382.880,"Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they're not, have measures on the books that don't take forever and a day to implement."
n000022,382.880,383.680,(SILENCE)
f000060,383.680,385.920,"Number two, change the tax code."
f000061,385.920,392.000,There are more deductions in the tax code for shutting plants down and moving overseas than there are for modernizing plant and equipment here.
n000023,392.000,392.600,(SILENCE)
f000062,392.600,393.780,Our competitors don't do that.
f000063,393.780,399.000,"Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas."
n000024,399.000,399.440,(SILENCE)
f000064,399.440,411.080,"Number three, stop the federal government's program that now gives low-interest loans and job training funds to companies that will actually shut down and move to other countries, but we won't do the same thing for plants that stay here."
n000025,411.080,411.560,(SILENCE)
f000065,411.560,415.720,So more trade but on fair terms -- and favor investment in America.
n000026,415.720,416.200,(SILENCE)
f000066,416.200,416.880,Thank you.
f000067,416.880,418.360,I think we have a question over here.
n000027,418.360,418.680,(SILENCE)
f000068,418.680,421.020,This is for Governor Clinton.
n000028,421.020,421.960,(SILENCE)
f000069,421.960,429.920,"In the real world, that is, outside of Washington, DC, compensation and achievement are based on goals defined and achieved."
n000029,429.920,430.640,(SILENCE)
f000070,430.640,433.400,My question is about the deficit.
n000030,433.400,433.960,(SILENCE)
f000071,433.960,451.600,"Would you define in specific dollar goals how much you would reduce the deficit in each of the 4 years of a Clinton administration and then enter into a legally binding contract with the American people, that if you did not achieve those goals that you would not seek a 2nd term?"
f000072,451.600,454.920,"Answer yes or no and then comment on your answer, please."
f000073,454.920,455.840,"No, and here's why."
n000031,455.840,457.000,(SILENCE)
f000074,457.000,458.240,And I'll tell you exactly why.
n000032,458.240,459.160,(SILENCE)
f000075,459.160,463.180,Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.
f000076,463.180,465.960,I'll tell you exactly what I think can be done.
f000077,465.960,470.040,I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy.
n000033,470.040,470.720,(SILENCE)
f000078,470.720,482.040,"Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you'd have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse."
n000034,482.040,482.600,(SILENCE)
f000079,482.600,493.180,"Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years."
f000080,493.180,512.160,"So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy."
f000081,512.160,522.140,"I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go."
f000082,522.140,524.160,If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.
n000035,524.160,524.560,(SILENCE)
f000083,524.560,529.720,"But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit."
n000036,529.720,530.120,(SILENCE)
f000084,530.120,532.560,"Let me also say, we're having an election today."
f000085,532.560,539.200,You'll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that.
n000037,539.200,539.520,(SILENCE)
f000086,539.520,540.260,Mr. President.
n000038,540.260,540.680,(SILENCE)
f000087,540.680,548.960,"Well, I'm a little confused here, because I don't see how you can grow the deficit down by raising people's taxes."
n000039,548.960,550.480,(SILENCE)
f000088,550.480,552.720,"You see, I don't think the American people are taxed too little."
f000089,552.720,553.860,I think they're taxed too much.
n000040,553.860,554.680,(SILENCE)
f000090,554.680,557.380,I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it.
f000091,557.380,559.000,I said that wasn't the right thing to do.
n000041,559.000,560.000,(SILENCE)
f000092,560.000,567.480,"Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220."
n000042,567.480,568.160,(SILENCE)
f000093,568.160,569.300,I don't believe that's the way to do it.
f000094,569.300,571.040,Here's some thing that'll help.
n000043,571.040,572.040,(SILENCE)
f000095,572.040,573.400,Give us a balanced budget amendment.
f000096,573.400,578.120,"He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment."
f000097,578.120,578.680,Have to do it.
n000044,578.680,579.120,(SILENCE)
f000098,579.120,580.520,I'd like the government to have that.
n000045,580.520,581.000,(SILENCE)
f000099,581.000,585.500,"And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch."
n000046,585.500,586.320,(SILENCE)
f000100,586.320,600.060,"I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature."
f000101,600.060,601.920,I've proposed another one.
f000102,601.920,604.480,Some sophisticates think it may be a little gimmicky.
f000103,604.480,605.120,I think it's good.
n000047,605.120,605.600,(SILENCE)
f000104,605.600,606.600,It's a check- off.
f000105,606.600,610.640,It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.
n000048,610.640,611.040,(SILENCE)
f000106,611.040,625.480,"You can check 10% of that if you want to, in the 1 box, and that 10%, $100, or if you're paying $10,000, whatever it is, $1000, check it off and make the government, make it lower the deficit by that amount."
n000049,625.480,625.960,(SILENCE)
f000107,625.960,633.240,"And if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board."
f000108,633.240,637.320,You'd exempt Social Security -- I don't want to tax or touch Social Security.
n000050,637.320,637.760,(SILENCE)
f000109,637.760,641.920,"I'm the president that said hey, don't mess with Social Security, and we haven't."
n000051,641.920,642.320,(SILENCE)
f000110,642.320,647.920,"So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question."
f000111,647.920,652.500,That's the main growing thing in the budget.
f000112,652.500,659.120,"The program that the president -- two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch."
n000052,659.120,659.560,(SILENCE)
f000113,659.560,667.500,"We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now."
f000114,667.500,671.080,I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.
n000053,671.080,671.640,(SILENCE)
f000115,671.640,673.140,"How about you, Mr. Perot?"
f000116,673.140,674.760,"Well, we're $4 trillion in debt."
f000117,674.760,678.440,"We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year."
f000118,678.440,682.520,"Now, the thing I love about it -- I'm just a businessman."
f000119,682.520,685.800,"I was down in Texas taking care of business, tending to my family."
f000120,685.800,688.340,This situation got so bad that I decided I'd better get into it.
f000121,688.340,690.100,The American people asked me to get into it.
f000122,690.100,698.640,But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.

f000123,699.720,702.880,"Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault."
n000055,702.880,703.400,(SILENCE)
f000124,703.400,705.420,And what I'm looking for is who did it?
n000056,705.420,706.720,(SILENCE)
f000125,706.720,710.520,"Now, they're the 2 folks involved so maybe if you put them together, they did it."

f000126,710.960,713.160,"Now, the facts are we have to fix it."
