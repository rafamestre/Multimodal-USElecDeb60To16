f000004,25.760,44.260,"My colleagues and I agreed to participate tonight, although the questioners are limited by the constraints of the format, because we thought with the League of Women Voters, that it is desirable to seek a comparison of views on a few issues in a joint appearance by the men who would be the next President of the United States."

f000020,159.040,175.080,"Elected officials have played along by promising to cure inflation while backing away from tough programs that might hurt one special interest group or another, and by actually adding inflationary elements to the system, such as indexing."

f000023,201.360,219.200,"Miss Loomis, I think it's very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign '80 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight - 221 million Americans - are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years."

f000027,235.000,256.080,"Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter."

f000028,256.560,274.320,"I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible."

n000028,317.320,317.920,(SILENCE)
f000033,317.920,341.000,"And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees."

f000034,341.480,349.980,"That we ought to ... in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion."
f000035,349.980,351.200,In other words....
f000036,351.200,351.440,Mr. Anderson.
f000037,351.440,352.720,"fiscal restraint, I think is necessary."
f000038,352.720,353.080,your time is up.
f000039,353.080,354.040,Ms. Loomis?
f000040,354.040,365.280,"Governor Reagan, repeating the question, and I would ask you, again, to engage in as many specifics as you possibly can."
f000041,365.280,373.820,"What politically unpopular measures are you willing to endorse, push and stay with that might provide real progress in reducing inflation?"
f000042,373.820,384.620,"I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those."
f000043,384.620,389.280,"perhaps, some special interest groups who are tied closely to government."
f000044,389.280,411.980,"I believe that inflation today is caused by government simply spending more than government takes in, at the same time that government has imposed upon business and industry, from the shopkeeper on the corner to the biggest industrial plant in America, countless harassing regulations and punitive taxes that have reduced productivity at the same time they have increased the cost of production."
f000045,411.980,420.120,"And when you are reducing productivity at the same time that you are turning out printing-press money in excessive amounts, you're causing inflation."
n000030,420.120,420.800,(SILENCE)
f000046,420.800,425.640,"And it isn't really higher prices, it's just, you are reducing the value of the money."

f000047,426.280,429.200,You are robbing the American people of their savings.
f000048,429.200,469.800,"And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings."
n000032,469.800,470.960,(SILENCE)
f000049,470.960,478.220,"Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight."
f000050,478.220,491.960,"But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on."
f000051,491.960,505.260,"I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections."
f000052,505.260,514.020,"conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget."
n000033,514.020,514.880,(SILENCE)
f000053,514.880,526.640,"We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year."
f000054,526.640,527.080,Your time is up.
f000055,527.080,529.400,...and $500 billion over the next five.
f000056,529.400,530.420,Mr. Anderson?
f000057,530.420,547.120,"Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline."
n000034,547.120,547.760,(SILENCE)
f000058,547.760,555.180,"I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that."
f000059,555.180,556.580,those imports have been reduced.
n000035,556.580,557.240,(SILENCE)
f000060,557.240,565.440,"And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30."
n000036,565.440,565.920,(SILENCE)
f000061,565.920,577.160,"In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers."
n000037,577.160,577.680,(SILENCE)
f000062,577.680,579.520,Whereas I have proposed we ought to take.

n000040,600.920,602.000,(SILENCE)
f000067,602.000,602.340,Mr. Reagan.
f000068,602.340,608.700,"Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline."
f000069,608.700,612.320,"It would still have gone up as much as it has, and the $.50 would be added on top of that."
f000070,612.320,618.760,"And it would be a tax paid by the consumers, and then we're asked to believe that some way, they would get this back to the consumers."
n000041,618.760,619.560,(SILENCE)
f000071,619.560,620.080,But why?
n000042,620.080,620.640,(SILENCE)
f000072,620.640,623.040,Why take it in the first place if you're going to give it back?
n000043,623.040,623.360,(SILENCE)
f000073,623.360,625.280,Why not leave it with them?
f000074,625.280,629.280,"And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he."
n000044,629.280,629.600,(SILENCE)
f000075,629.600,632.220,"or 15 months ago, on what he believed in."
f000076,632.220,647.500,"Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country."
f000077,647.500,652.420,The next question goes to Mr. Reagan from Daniel Greenberg.
f000078,652.420,662.560,"Well, gentlemen, what I'd like to say first is, I think the panel and the audience would appreciate responsiveness to the questions, rather than repetitions of your campaign addresses."
f000079,662.560,680.800,"My question for the Governor is: Every serious examination of the future supply of energy and other essential resources - including air, land and water - finds that we face shortages and skyrocketing prices, and that, in many ways, we're pushing the environment to dangerous limits."
n000045,680.800,681.960,(SILENCE)
f000080,681.960,698.360,"I'd like to know, specifically, what changes you would encourage and require in American lifestyles in automobile use, housing, land use and general consumption, to meet problems that aren't going to respond to campaign lullabies about minor conservation efforts and more production?"
n000046,698.360,700.880,(SILENCE)
f000081,700.880,705.360,"Well, I believe that conservation, at course, is worthy in and of itself."

f000082,706.000,711.920,"Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it."
n000048,711.920,712.560,(SILENCE)
f000083,712.560,724.960,"But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply."
n000049,724.960,725.920,(SILENCE)
f000084,725.920,733.740,"To say that we are limited, and at a dangerous point in this country with regard to energy, I think, is to ignore the fact."
f000085,733.740,741.080,"The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used."
n000050,741.080,741.760,(SILENCE)
f000086,741.760,747.200,But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.

f000088,750.960,768.280,"There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago."

f000092,787.000,804.160,"the most stringent of safety requirements, could meet our energy needs for the next couple of decades while we go forward exploring the areas of solar power and other forms of energy that might be renewable and that would not be exhaustible."

f000101,871.680,893.400,"Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years' supply of natural gas, 47 years' supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really."

f000105,917.560,926.620,"I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf."
f000106,926.620,937.300,"But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile."
