HEAD,0.000,6.000,
f000001,6.000,8.140,Good evening.
f000002,8.140,9.620,I'm Bill Shadel of ABC News.
n000001,9.620,11.000,(SILENCE)
f000003,11.000,19.100,It's my privilege this evening to preside at this the third in the series of meetings on radio and television of the two major presidential candidates.
f000004,19.100,28.240,Now like the last meeting the subjects to be discussed will be suggested by questions from a panel of correspondents.
f000005,28.240,34.920,"Unlike the first two programs, however, the two candidates will not be sharing the same platform."
f000006,34.920,55.000,"In New York the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator John F. Kennedy; separated by three thousand miles in a Los Angeles studio, the Republican presidential nominee, Vice President Richard M. Nixon; now joined for tonight's discussion by a network of electronic facilities which permits each candidate to see and hear the other."

f000007,55.720,56.760,"Good evening, Senator Kennedy."

f000008,57.360,57.640,"Good evening, Mr. Shadel."
f000009,57.640,59.940,"And good evening to you, Vice President Nixon."
f000010,59.940,62.080,"Good evening, Mr. Shadel."
n000004,62.080,62.440,(SILENCE)
f000011,62.440,65.680,And now to meet the panel of correspondents.
f000012,65.680,77.460,"Frank McGee, NBC News; Charles Van Fremd, CBS News; Douglass Cater, Reporter magazine; Roscoe Drummond, New York Herald Tribune."
n000005,77.460,79.480,(SILENCE)
f000013,79.480,91.640,"Now, as you've probably noted, the four reporters include a newspaper man and a magazine reporter; these two selected by lot by the press secretaries of the candidates from among the reporters traveling with the candidates."
n000006,91.640,91.960,(SILENCE)
f000014,91.960,95.840,The broadcasting representatives were chosen by their companies.
f000015,95.840,103.880,The rules for this evening have been agreed upon by the representatives of both candidates and the radio and television networks and I should like to read them.
f000016,103.880,110.340,There will be no opening statements by the candidates nor any closing summation.
n000007,110.340,111.800,(SILENCE)
f000017,111.800,115.720,The entire hour will be devoted to answering questions from the reporters.
n000008,115.720,117.120,(SILENCE)
f000018,117.120,121.680,Each candidate to be questioned in turn with opportunity for comment by the other.

f000019,122.840,130.920,"Each answer will be limited to two and one-half minutes, each comment to one and a half minutes."
f000020,130.920,135.520,The reporters are free to ask any question they choose on any subject.
f000021,135.520,139.560,Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked.
f000022,139.560,143.340,Time alone will dete- determine who will be asked the final question.
n000010,143.340,144.680,(SILENCE)
f000023,144.680,148.480,Now the first question is from Mr. McGee and is for Senator Kennedy.
n000011,148.480,149.680,(SILENCE)
f000024,149.680,159.880,"Senator Kennedy, yesterday you used the words ""trigger-happy"" in referring to Vice President Richard Nixon's stand on defending the islands of Quemoy and Matsu."
n000012,159.880,160.960,(SILENCE)
f000025,160.960,168.000,"Last week on a program like this one, you said the next president would come face to face with a serious crisis in Berlin."
n000013,168.000,169.000,(SILENCE)
f000026,169.000,174.200,So the question is: would you take military action to defend Berlin?
n000014,174.200,175.160,(SILENCE)
f000027,175.160,183.120,"Mr. McGee, we have a contractual right to be in Berlin coming out of the conversations at Potsdam and of World War II."
n000015,183.120,183.920,(SILENCE)
f000028,183.920,190.560,That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; it's been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO.
n000016,190.560,191.200,(SILENCE)
f000029,191.200,195.400,I've stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin.
n000017,195.400,196.160,(SILENCE)
f000030,196.160,200.720,It is a commitment that we have to meet if we're going to protect the security of Western Europe.
n000018,200.720,201.520,(SILENCE)
f000031,201.520,212.960,And therefore on this question I don't think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I'm sure there isn't any doubt in the mind of the Russians.
n000019,212.960,213.520,(SILENCE)
f000032,213.520,217.360,We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.
n000020,217.360,219.080,(SILENCE)
f000033,219.080,220.400,"Mr. Vice President, do you wish to comment?"
f000034,220.400,220.740,Yes.
f000035,220.740,235.220,"As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that - to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans."
f000036,235.220,237.520,I resent that comment.
f000037,237.520,242.840,"I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war."
n000021,242.840,243.560,(SILENCE)
f000038,243.560,246.280,I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.
n000022,246.280,247.040,(SILENCE)
f000039,247.040,251.160,I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.
n000023,251.160,251.960,(SILENCE)
f000040,251.960,254.680,There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.
n000024,254.680,255.480,(SILENCE)
f000041,255.480,260.580,I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.
f000042,260.580,264.280,But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.
f000043,264.280,269.240,We had a war when we came into power in 1953.
f000044,269.240,276.680,We got rid of that; we've kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn't indicate that we're trigger-happy.
n000025,276.680,277.240,(SILENCE)
f000045,277.240,279.480,"We've been strong, but we haven't been trigger-happy."
n000026,279.480,280.480,(SILENCE)
f000046,280.480,302.140,"As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin."
f000047,302.140,303.700,The next question is by Mr.
f000048,303.700,306.700,Von Fremd for Vice President Nixon.
f000049,306.700,311.140,"Mr. Vice President, a two-part question concerning the offshore islands in the Formosa Straits."
n000027,311.140,311.880,(SILENCE)
f000050,311.880,333.360,"If you were president and the Chinese Communists tomorrow began an invasion of Quemoy and Matsu, would you launch the uh - United States into a war by sending the Seventh Fleet and other military forces to resist this aggression; and secondly, if the uh - regular conventional forces failed to halt such uh - such an invasion, would you authorize the use of nuclear weapons?"
n000028,333.360,334.800,(SILENCE)
f000051,334.800,335.000,Mr.
f000052,335.000,345.200,"Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack."
n000029,345.200,346.000,(SILENCE)
f000053,346.000,380.560,"I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa."
f000054,380.560,390.400,"But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States."
f000055,390.400,410.800,"I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested - to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance - is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war."
n000030,410.800,411.800,(SILENCE)
f000056,411.800,412.500,This is the history of dealing with dictators.
f000057,412.500,415.140,This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.
f000058,415.140,418.720,We tried this with Hitler.
f000059,418.720,421.440,It didn't work.
n000031,421.440,422.160,(SILENCE)
f000060,422.160,432.840,"He wanted first uh - we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted."
f000061,432.840,435.680,Now what do the Chinese Communists want?
f000062,435.680,441.800,They don't want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don't want just Formosa; they want the world.
f000063,441.800,449.920,"And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them."
n000032,449.920,450.520,(SILENCE)
f000064,450.520,456.820,"It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?"
f000065,456.820,475.160,"I've often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them?"
f000066,475.160,486.060,"And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory - this or any others - in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace."
n000033,486.060,487.520,(SILENCE)
f000067,487.520,489.160,"Senator Kennedy, do you wish to comment?"
n000034,489.160,489.760,(SILENCE)
f000068,489.760,490.040,Yes.
f000069,490.040,498.800,The whole th- the United States now has a treaty - which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 - to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island.
n000035,498.800,499.680,(SILENCE)
f000070,499.680,505.040,"The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China."
n000036,505.040,505.840,(SILENCE)
f000071,505.840,522.480,"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu."""
f000072,522.480,524.160,"Now, that is the issue."
n000037,524.160,524.680,(SILENCE)
f000073,524.680,527.860,I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.
f000074,527.860,530.180,I support it and the Pescadores Island.
f000075,530.180,531.280,That is the present American position.
n000038,531.280,532.320,(SILENCE)
f000076,532.320,535.240,The treaty does not include these two islands.
f000077,535.240,541.240,Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.
f000078,541.240,552.860,"I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty."
n000039,552.860,553.920,(SILENCE)
f000079,553.920,567.120,"Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa."
n000040,567.120,567.640,(SILENCE)
f000080,567.640,573.200,"Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American."

n000044,593.560,595.120,(SILENCE)
f000085,595.120,598.760,Mr. Cater has the next question for Senator Kennedy.
f000086,598.760,606.200,"Senator Kennedy, last week you said that before we should hold another summit conference, that it was important that the United States build its strength."
n000045,606.200,607.320,(SILENCE)
f000087,607.320,609.840,Modern weapons take quite a long time to build.

n000046,616.160,617.120,(SILENCE)
f000089,617.120,627.200,And do you think that there can be any new initiatives on the grounds of nuclear disarmament uh - nuclear control or weapons control d- uh - during this period?

f000090,627.920,637.000,"Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces."

f000093,647.520,670.880,"Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity."

f000094,671.960,684.640,"There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity - including Red China - by the end of the presidential office in 1964."

f000121,832.840,848.520,"He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for - which he did - that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment - and on this particular - or for an amendment, I should say - which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve."
f000122,848.520,869.640,"And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator's own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans - put them on record - against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands."

f000125,879.200,890.440,Uh - it is my understanding that President Eisenhower never advocated that Quemoy and Matsu should be defended under all circumstances as a matter of principle.
f000126,890.440,900.320,I heard Secretary Dulles at a press conference in fifty-eight say that he thought that it was a mistake for Chiang Kai-shek to deploy troops to these islands.

f000128,907.600,928.780,"Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles' press conference, I think if you read it all - and I know that you have - you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended."
f000129,928.780,946.460,"There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don't think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles' statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa."
