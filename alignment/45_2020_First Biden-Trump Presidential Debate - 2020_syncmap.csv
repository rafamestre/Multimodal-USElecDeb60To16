f001781,5389.520,5396.080,"Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically."
n000555,5396.080,5396.440,(SILENCE)
f001782,5396.440,5407.600,"It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 01:06:28] the deadline."
f001783,5407.600,5414.480,"So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?"
f001784,5414.480,5419.020,"I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here’s the deal."
f001785,5419.020,5424.920,"When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you’re supposed to have an affidavit."
f001786,5424.920,5428.040,"If you didn’t know, you have someone say that, this is me."

f001789,5446.520,5447.600,That is totally legitimate.
n000558,5447.600,5448.080,(SILENCE)
f001790,5448.080,5448.520,All right.

f001797,5453.520,5455.200,You know it can’t be done.
f001798,5455.200,5457.840,"You know it can’t, and already, there’s been fraud [crosstalk 01:07:19]-"

f001800,5462.960,5464.560,We can keep talking.
f001801,5464.560,5477.200,"In eight states, [crosstalk 01:07:27] election workers are prohibited, currently by law, eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day."
f001802,5477.200,5487.280,"That means that it’s likely, because there’s going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days."
f001803,5487.280,5488.440,It could be weeks-
f001804,5488.440,5489.000,Could be months-

f001818,5533.720,5534.500,You know why?
f001819,5534.500,5536.760,Because bad things happen in Philadelphia.
f001820,5536.760,5537.400,Bad things.
n000564,5537.400,5537.800,(SILENCE)

f001824,5542.440,5543.600,You’re urging them what?
f001825,5543.600,5545.320,… I am 100% on board.
n000566,5545.320,5545.640,(SILENCE)

f001832,5554.600,5555.120,… to take to the streets?
f001833,5555.120,5556.600,It means you have a fraudulent election.

f001840,5572.720,5573.340,There were military.
f001841,5573.340,5575.520,They all had the name Trump on them.
f001842,5575.520,5576.640,Vice President Biden-
