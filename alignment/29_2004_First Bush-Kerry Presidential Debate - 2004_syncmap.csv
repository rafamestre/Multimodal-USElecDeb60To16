f000856,3998.920,4002.440,They've got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing.
f000857,4002.440,4006.440,And that's going to require more than is on the table today.
f000858,4006.440,4011.660,I also believe that it is -- one of the reasons we can't do it is we're overextended.

f000859,4012.280,4014.360,Ask the people in the armed forces today.
f000860,4014.360,4018.080,We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.
f000861,4018.080,4031.640,"We've got a backdoor draft taking place in America today: people with stop-loss programs where they're told you can't get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing."
f000862,4031.640,4036.160,So this is the way the president has overextended the United States.
f000863,4036.160,4045.680,"That's why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe."
f000864,4045.680,4053.820,I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world.

f001007,4773.480,4773.860,All right.
f001008,4773.860,4776.480,"Mr. President, this is the last question."
f001009,4776.480,4777.640,And two minutes.
f001010,4777.640,4783.880,"It's a new subject -- new question, and it has to do with President Putin and Russia."
f001011,4783.880,4794.360,Did you misjudge him or are you -- do you feel that what he is doing in the name of antiterrorism by changing some democratic processes is OK?
f001012,4794.360,4798.360,"No, I don't think it's OK, and said so publicly."
f001013,4798.360,4817.200,"I think that there needs to be checks and balances in a democracy, and made that very clear that by consolidating power in the central government, he's sending a signal to the Western world and United States that perhaps he doesn't believe in checks and balances, and I told him that."
f001014,4817.200,4821.640,"I mean, he's also a strong ally in the war on terror."
n000404,4821.640,4823.160,(SILENCE)
f001015,4823.160,4831.560,"He is -- listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids."

f001016,4832.240,4833.840,"That's the nature of the enemy, by the way."
f001017,4833.840,4838.920,That's why we need to be firm and resolved in bringing them to justice.
f001018,4838.920,4842.980,"That's precisely what Vladimir Putin understands, as well."
f001019,4842.980,4846.120,I've got a good relation with Vladimir.
f001020,4846.120,4856.500,"And it's important that we do have a good relation, because that enables me to better comment to him, and to better to discuss with him, some of the decisions he makes."
f001021,4856.500,4866.200,"I found that, in this world, that it's important to establish good personal relationships with people so that when you have disagreements, you're able to disagree in a way that is effective."
f001022,4866.200,4870.540,And so I've told him my opinion.

f001029,4906.240,4917.520,"Well, let me just say quickly that I've had an extraordinary experience of watching up close and personal that transition in Russia, because I was there right after the transformation."
f001030,4917.520,4930.180,"And I was probably one of the first senators, along with Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a former senator, to go down into the KGB underneath Treblinka Square and see reams of files with names in them."
f001031,4930.180,4934.840,It sort of brought home the transition to democracy that Russia was trying to make.

f001034,4941.500,4947.040,Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations.
f001035,4947.040,4950.100,His political opposition is being put in jail.
f001036,4950.100,4955.400,"And I think it's very important to the United States, obviously, to have a working relationship that is good."
f001037,4955.400,4956.880,This is a very important country to us.
f001038,4956.880,4958.000,We want a partnership.
f001039,4958.000,4960.820,But we always have to stand up for democracy.
f001040,4960.820,4966.060,"As George Will said the other day, ""Freedom on the march; not in Russia right now."""
f001041,4966.060,4969.960,"Now, I'd like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks."

f001044,4980.560,4987.320,"I mean, this is the president who said ""There were weapons of mass destruction,"" said ""Mission accomplished,"" said we could fight the war on the cheap -- none of which were true."

f001047,4993.980,4998.540,"Because China has an interest in the outcome, too."
f001048,4998.540,5002.080,"Thirty seconds, Mr. President."
f001049,5002.080,5003.360,You know my opinion on North Korea.
f001050,5003.360,5004.000,I can't say it any more plainly.

f001054,5009.280,5010.360,"He used the word ""truth"" again."
f001055,5010.360,5011.960,Did that raise any hackles with you?
f001056,5011.960,5015.200,"Oh, I'm a pretty calm guy."
f001057,5015.200,5016.880,I don't take it personally.
f001058,5016.880,5017.980,OK. All right.
f001059,5017.980,5025.920,"You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat."
