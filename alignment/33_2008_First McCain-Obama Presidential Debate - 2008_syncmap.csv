HEAD,0.000,8.000,
f000001,8.000,15.040,Good evening from the Ford Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Mississippi in Oxford.
n000001,15.040,15.440,(SILENCE)
f000002,15.440,31.280,"I'm Jim Lehrer of the NewsHour on PBS, and I welcome you to the first of the 2008 presidential debates between the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, and the Democratic nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois."
n000002,31.280,31.880,(SILENCE)
f000003,31.880,40.720,The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the three other presidential and vice presidential debates coming in October.
n000003,40.720,41.520,(SILENCE)
f000004,41.520,51.240,"Tonight's will primarily be about foreign policy and national security, which, by definition, includes the global financial crisis."
n000004,51.240,51.600,(SILENCE)
f000005,51.600,54.800,It will be divided roughly into nine-minute segments.
n000005,54.800,55.240,(SILENCE)
f000006,55.240,67.840,Direct exchanges between the candidates and moderator follow-ups are permitted after each candidate has two minutes to answer the lead question in an order determined by a coin toss.

f000007,68.400,71.840,The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me.
n000007,71.840,72.160,(SILENCE)
f000008,72.160,75.640,They have not been shared or cleared with anyone.
n000008,75.640,76.360,(SILENCE)
f000009,76.360,85.720,"The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent, no cheers, no applause, no noise of any kind, except right now, as we welcome Senators Obama and McCain."
f000010,85.720,109.760,(APPLAUSE)  Let me begin with something General Eisenhower said in his 1952 presidential campaign.
f000011,109.760,113.940,"Quote, ""We must achieve both security and solvency."
f000012,113.940,121.960,"In fact, the foundation of military strength is economic strength,"" end quote."
n000009,121.960,122.520,(SILENCE)
f000013,122.520,124.920,"With that in mind, the first lead question."
n000010,124.920,125.400,(SILENCE)
f000014,125.400,139.280,"Gentlemen, at this very moment tonight, where do you stand on the financial recovery plan?"
n000011,139.280,139.760,(SILENCE)
f000015,139.760,142.720,"First response to you, Senator Obama."
f000016,142.720,143.580,You have two minutes.
f000017,143.580,149.680,"Well, thank you very much, Jim, and thanks to the commission and the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, for hosting us tonight."
n000012,149.680,150.000,(SILENCE)
f000018,150.000,155.240,I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.
f000019,155.240,159.480,"You know, we are at a defining moment in our history."
f000020,159.480,166.240,"Our nation is involved in two wars, and we are going through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression."
f000021,166.240,177.480,"And although we've heard a lot about Wall Street, those of you on Main Street I think have been struggling for a while, and you recognize that this could have an impact on all sectors of the economy."
f000022,177.480,179.680,"And you're wondering, how's it going to affect me?"
f000023,179.680,180.960,How's it going to affect my job?
f000024,180.960,182.160,How's it going to affect my house?
n000013,182.160,182.560,(SILENCE)
f000025,182.560,186.620,How's it going to affect my retirement savings or my ability to send my children to college?
n000014,186.620,187.280,(SILENCE)
f000026,187.280,192.000,"So we have to move swiftly, and we have to move wisely."
f000027,192.000,200.220,And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.
n000015,200.220,200.840,(SILENCE)
f000028,200.840,207.600,"Number one, we've got to make sure that we've got oversight over this whole process; $700 billion, potentially, is a lot of money."
n000016,207.600,208.160,(SILENCE)
f000029,208.160,221.080,"Number two, we've got to make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains, if the market -- and when the market returns."
f000030,221.080,228.840,"Number three, we've got to make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes."
n000017,228.840,229.520,(SILENCE)
f000031,229.520,237.260,"And, number four, we've got to make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country."
f000032,237.260,258.340,"Now, we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down."
f000033,258.340,260.120,It hasn't worked.
n000018,260.120,260.640,(SILENCE)
f000034,260.640,267.160,And I think that the fundamentals of the economy have to be measured by whether or not the middle class is getting a fair shake.
f000035,267.160,270.540,"That's why I'm running for president, and that's what I hope we're going to be talking about tonight."
n000019,270.540,271.360,(SILENCE)
f000036,271.360,272.080,"Senator McCain, two minutes."
f000037,272.080,273.600,"Well, thank you, Jim."
f000038,273.600,275.120,And thanks to everybody.
f000039,275.120,277.920,And I do have a sad note tonight.
f000040,277.920,280.860,Senator Kennedy is in the hospital.
n000020,280.860,281.560,(SILENCE)
f000041,281.560,283.680,He's a dear and beloved friend to all of us.
f000042,283.680,287.560,Our thoughts and prayers go out to the lion of the Senate.
n000021,287.560,288.080,(SILENCE)
f000043,288.080,293.840,I also want to thank the University of Mississippi for hosting us tonight.
n000022,293.840,294.880,(SILENCE)
f000044,294.880,299.680,"And, Jim, I -- I've been not feeling too great about a lot of things lately."
f000045,299.680,302.400,So have a lot of Americans who are facing challenges.
f000046,302.400,304.800,"But I'm feeling a little better tonight, and I'll tell you why."
n000023,304.800,305.760,(SILENCE)
f000047,305.760,320.400,"Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in."
n000024,320.400,321.120,(SILENCE)
f000048,321.120,324.320,And have no doubt about the magnitude of this crisis.
n000025,324.320,324.960,(SILENCE)
f000049,324.960,327.840,And we're not talking about failure of institutions on Wall Street.
n000026,327.840,328.560,(SILENCE)
f000050,328.560,344.320,"We're talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while."
f000051,344.320,353.680,"But the point is -- the point is, we have finally seen Republicans and Democrats sitting down and negotiating together and coming up with a package."
n000027,353.680,354.600,(SILENCE)
f000052,354.600,357.200,This package has transparency in it.
f000053,357.200,359.280,It has to have accountability and oversight.
n000028,359.280,359.800,(SILENCE)
f000054,359.800,366.040,"It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans."
f000055,366.040,370.640,We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it.
n000029,370.640,371.280,(SILENCE)
f000056,371.280,377.020,"And, yes, I went back to Washington, and I met with my Republicans in the House of Representatives."
n000030,377.020,378.040,(SILENCE)
f000057,378.040,381.320,"And they weren't part of the negotiations, and I understand that."
n000031,381.320,381.880,(SILENCE)
f000058,381.880,388.560,And it was the House Republicans that decided that they would be part of the solution to this problem.
f000059,388.560,393.240,But I want to emphasize one point to all Americans tonight.
f000060,393.240,395.280,This isn't the beginning of the end of this crisis.
n000032,395.280,395.680,(SILENCE)
f000061,395.680,402.760,"This is the end of the beginning, if we come out with a package that will keep these institutions stable."
n000033,402.760,403.560,(SILENCE)
f000062,403.560,405.480,And we've got a lot of work to do.
n000034,405.480,406.360,(SILENCE)
f000063,406.360,407.400,And we've got to create jobs.
n000035,407.400,408.000,(SILENCE)
f000064,408.000,411.860,"And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil."
n000036,411.860,413.280,(SILENCE)
f000065,413.280,415.160,"All right, let's go back to my question."
f000066,415.160,417.760,How do you all stand on the recovery plan?
f000067,417.760,419.380,And talk to each other about it.
f000068,419.380,420.840,We've got five minutes.
f000069,420.840,422.740,We can negotiate a deal right here.
f000070,422.740,428.640,"But, I mean, are you -- do you favor this plan, Senator Obama, and you, Senator McCain?"
f000071,428.640,430.260,Do you -- are you in favor of this plan?
f000072,430.260,432.160,We haven't seen the language yet.
f000073,432.160,435.520,And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.
f000074,435.520,442.500,"So, for the viewers who are watching, I am optimistic about the capacity of us to come together with a plan."
n000037,442.500,443.120,(SILENCE)
f000075,443.120,449.640,"The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?"
n000038,449.640,450.080,(SILENCE)
f000076,450.080,464.200,"Two years ago, I warned that, because of the subprime lending mess, because of the lax regulation, that we were potentially going to have a problem and tried to stop some of the abuses in mortgages that were taking place at the time."
n000039,464.200,464.640,(SILENCE)
f000077,464.640,476.180,"Last year, I wrote to the secretary of the Treasury to make sure that he understood the magnitude of this problem and to call on him to bring all the stakeholders together to try to deal with it."
f000078,476.180,482.200,"So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term."
f000079,482.200,485.020,And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.
f000080,485.020,490.860,"But we're also going to have to look at, how is it that we shredded so many regulations?"
f000081,490.860,496.380,We did not set up a 21st-century regulatory framework to deal with these problems.
f000082,496.380,502.120,And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad.
n000040,502.120,503.640,(SILENCE)
f000083,503.640,505.920,"Are you going to vote for the plan, Senator McCain?"
f000084,505.920,507.120,I -- I hope so.
f000085,507.120,507.640,And I...
f000086,507.640,508.800,As a United States senator...
f000087,508.800,509.040,Sure.
f000088,509.040,510.120,... you're going to vote for the plan?
f000089,510.120,510.480,Sure.
n000041,510.480,511.000,(SILENCE)
f000090,511.000,523.320,"But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that."
f000091,523.320,525.020,A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.
n000042,525.020,526.040,(SILENCE)
f000092,526.040,527.800,But there's also the issue of responsibility.
n000043,527.800,528.600,(SILENCE)
f000093,528.600,530.480,You've mentioned President Dwight David Eisenhower.
n000044,530.480,531.600,(SILENCE)
f000094,531.600,537.880,"President Eisenhower, on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letters."
n000045,537.880,538.600,(SILENCE)
f000095,538.600,549.980,"One of them was a letter congratulating the great members of the military and allies that had conducted and succeeded in the greatest invasion in history, still to this day, and forever."
f000096,549.980,558.760,"And he wrote out another letter, and that was a letter of resignation from the United States Army for the failure of the landings at Normandy."
n000046,558.760,559.560,(SILENCE)
f000097,559.560,562.280,Somehow we've lost that accountability.
n000047,562.280,562.840,(SILENCE)
f000098,562.840,569.080,I've been heavily criticized because I called for the resignation of the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
n000048,569.080,570.480,(SILENCE)
f000099,570.480,576.920,"We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed."
n000049,576.920,577.680,(SILENCE)
f000100,577.680,591.160,"But somehow in Washington today -- and I'm afraid on Wall Street -- greed is rewarded, excess is rewarded, and corruption -- or certainly failure to carry out our responsibility is rewarded."
n000050,591.160,591.760,(SILENCE)
f000101,591.760,596.840,"As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration."
n000051,596.840,597.200,(SILENCE)
f000102,597.200,599.120,And I promise you that that will happen.
n000052,599.120,599.880,(SILENCE)
f000103,599.880,604.320,"Do you have something directly to say, Senator Obama, to Senator McCain about what he just said?"
f000104,604.320,609.360,"Well, I think Senator McCain's absolutely right that we need more responsibility, but we need it not just when there's a crisis."
n000053,609.360,610.080,(SILENCE)
f000105,610.080,620.420,"I mean, we've had years in which the reigning economic ideology has been what's good for Wall Street, but not what's good for Main Street."
f000106,620.420,623.920,And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.
f000107,623.920,644.680,"And that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound."
f000108,644.680,646.620,Say it directly to him.
f000109,646.620,649.120,I do not think that they are.
f000110,649.120,650.400,Say it directly to him.
f000111,650.400,655.880,"Well, the -- John, 10 days ago, you said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound."
f000112,655.880,656.200,And...
f000113,656.200,657.280,Are you afraid I couldn't hear him?
f000114,657.280,657.281,(LAUGHTER)
f000115,657.281,659.540,I'm just determined to get you all to talk to each other.
f000116,659.540,661.160,I'm going to try.
f000117,661.160,663.200,The -- and I just fundamentally disagree.
f000118,663.200,683.680,"And unless we are holding ourselves accountable day in, day out, not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on."
n000054,683.680,684.280,(SILENCE)
f000119,684.280,687.380,They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments.
n000055,687.380,688.000,(SILENCE)
f000120,688.000,690.060,We haven't been paying attention to them.
f000121,690.060,693.620,"And if you look at our tax policies, it's a classic example."
f000122,693.620,697.840,"So, Senator McCain, do you agree with what Senator Obama just said?"
f000123,697.840,699.560,"And, if you don't, tell him what you disagree with."
f000124,699.560,702.400,"No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system."
f000125,702.400,704.800,We've got fundamental problems in the system.
n000056,704.800,705.480,(SILENCE)
f000126,705.480,714.080,"And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and in the Wall Street."
f000127,714.080,718.280,So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go.
f000128,718.280,728.240,"And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis."
n000057,728.240,729.120,(SILENCE)
f000129,729.120,735.380,But I have a fundamental belief in the goodness and strength of the American worker.
f000130,735.380,739.340,"And the American worker is the most productive, the most innovative."
n000058,739.340,739.880,(SILENCE)
f000131,739.880,743.260,"America is still the greatest producer, exporter and importer."
f000132,743.260,749.060,"But we've got to get through these times, but I have a fundamental belief in the United States of America."
f000133,749.060,753.600,"And I still believe, under the right leadership, our best days are ahead of us."
n000059,753.600,753.920,(SILENCE)
f000134,753.920,758.140,"All right, let's go to the next lead question, which is essentially following up on this same subject."
f000135,758.140,762.000,"And you get two minutes to begin with, Senator McCain."
f000136,762.000,774.980,"And using your word ""fundamental,"" are there fundamental differences between your approach and Senator Obama's approach to what you would do as president to lead this country out of the financial crisis?"
f000137,774.980,779.340,"Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control in Washington."
f000138,779.340,781.520,It's completely out of control.
n000060,781.520,781.960,(SILENCE)
f000139,781.960,791.160,It's gone -- we have now presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the Great Society.
n000061,791.160,792.120,(SILENCE)
f000140,792.120,797.480,"We Republicans came to power to change government, and government changed us."
n000062,797.480,798.280,(SILENCE)

f000684,3959.680,3972.220,"But we are also going to have to, I believe, engage in tough direct diplomacy with Iran and this is a major difference I have with Senator McCain, this notion that by not talking to people we are punishing them has not worked."

f000692,4047.660,4061.400,"The point is that throughout history, whether it be Ronald Reagan, who wouldn't sit down with Brezhnev, Andropov or Chernenko until Gorbachev was ready with glasnost and perestroika."

f000694,4069.860,4074.260,"Look, I'll sit down with anybody, but there's got to be pre-conditions."

f000697,4087.320,4088.380,So let's talk about this.
f000698,4088.380,4093.040,"First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran."
f000699,4093.040,4095.180,So he may not be the right person to talk to.

f000722,4218.680,4232.200,"When we re-engaged -- because, again, the Bush administration reversed course on this -- then we have at least made some progress, although right now, because of the problems in North Korea, we are seeing it on shaky ground."

f000732,4286.120,4287.000,He did not say that.
f000733,4287.000,4287.400,Of course not.
f000734,4287.400,4291.540,He said that there could be secretary-level and lower level meetings.
f000735,4291.540,4292.700,I've always encouraged them.
f000736,4292.700,4297.360,The Iranians have met with Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad.

f000746,4364.680,4373.780,"Look, I mean, Senator McCain keeps on using this example that suddenly the president would just meet with somebody without doing any preparation, without having low-level talks."
f000747,4373.780,4376.460,"Nobody's been talking about that, and Senator McCain knows it."
f000748,4376.460,4378.600,This is a mischaracterization of my position.

f000753,4416.800,4417.760,So let me get this right.

f000759,4440.280,4441.080,We will take a look.

f000776,4478.340,4499.280,"Well, I think that, given what's happened over the last several weeks and months, our entire Russian approach has to be evaluated, because a resurgent and very aggressive Russia is a threat to the peace and stability of the region."
f000777,4499.280,4502.500,Their actions in Georgia were unacceptable.
f000778,4502.500,4505.200,They were unwarranted.

n000329,4915.080,4915.800,(SILENCE)
f000842,4915.800,4926.620,"And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil."
f000843,4926.620,4930.040,So we can't simply drill our way out of the problem.
f000844,4930.040,4940.960,"What we're going to have to do is to approach it through alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel, and, yes, nuclear energy, clean-coal technology."
f000845,4940.960,4947.560,"And, you know, I've got a plan for us to make a significant investment over the next 10 years to do that."
f000846,4947.560,4954.640,"And I have to say, Senator McCain and I, I think agree on the importance of energy, but Senator McCain mentioned earlier the importance of looking at a record."

f000858,5001.680,5006.920,And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.
n000333,5006.920,5007.400,(SILENCE)
f000859,5007.400,5016.280,"And we know that, if we drill off-shore and exploit a lot of these reserves, it will help, at temporarily, relieve our energy requirements."

f000867,5030.680,5041.720,That was the key legislation at the time and put us on the road to eliminating this issue of nuclear waste and the nuclear fuel that has to be taken care of.
f000868,5041.720,5043.680,I -- I just have to correct the record here.
f000869,5043.680,5047.020,I have never said that I object to nuclear waste.
f000870,5047.020,5049.640,What I've said is that we have to store it safely.
f000871,5049.640,5052.840,"And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona."
f000872,5052.840,5053.180,All right.
f000873,5053.180,5054.520,"I've got to make this point, Jim."
f000874,5054.520,5054.680,OK.
f000875,5054.680,5055.080,He objects...

f000892,5094.120,5098.060,"I have a long record on that, on a long series of reforms."
f000893,5098.060,5110.320,"But after 9/11, Senator Joe Lieberman and I decided that we needed a commission, and that was a commission to investigate 9/11, and find out what happened, and fix it."

f000896,5125.120,5129.940,"And there were a series of recommendations, as I recall, more than 40."
f000897,5129.940,5136.420,And I'm happy to say that we've gotten written into law most of those reforms recommended by that commission.
f000898,5136.420,5144.420,"I'm proud of that work, again, bipartisan, reaching across the aisle, working together, Democrat and Republican alike."
f000899,5144.420,5147.900,So we have a long way to go in our intelligence services.
f000900,5147.900,5150.560,We have to do a better job in human intelligence.
f000901,5150.560,5159.320,And we've got to -- to make sure that we have people who are trained interrogators so that we don't ever torture a prisoner ever again.

f000926,5286.580,5287.440,That's going to be critical.
