f000982,4490.120,4497.820,This -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction.

f001002,4526.760,4529.920,-- all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered.
f001003,4529.920,4543.600,"Because what I -- what I want to do, Mr. President, stand there a second, because I want to introduce you to Nina Gonzalez, who brought up a question that we hear a lot, both over the Internet and from this crowd."
f001004,4543.600,4553.860,"President Obama, during the Democratic National Convention in 2008, you stated you wanted to keep AK-47s out of the hands of criminals."
f001005,4553.860,4562.160,What has your administration done or planned to do to limit the availability of assault weapons?
f001006,4562.160,4567.260,"We're a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment."
f001007,4567.260,4578.300,We've got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.
f001008,4578.300,4584.260,"But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency, where I've had to comfort families who have lost somebody."
f001009,4584.260,4587.800,Most recently out in Aurora.
f001010,4587.800,4602.120,"You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater."

f001012,4606.000,4619.400,"And we spent some time, and we said a prayer and, remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable, good as new."
f001013,4619.400,4631.600,But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.
f001014,4631.600,4647.360,"So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement."
n000471,4647.360,4648.240,(SILENCE)
f001015,4648.240,4655.920,But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters don't belong on our streets.
n000472,4655.920,4657.360,(SILENCE)
f001016,4657.360,4663.120,And so what I'm trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.
f001017,4663.120,4671.040,Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.
f001018,4671.040,4674.600,But part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence.
n000473,4674.600,4675.200,(SILENCE)
f001019,4675.200,4679.820,"Because frankly, in my home town of Chicago, there's an awful lot of violence and they're not using AK-47s."
f001020,4679.820,4680.400,They're using cheap hand guns.
n000474,4680.400,4681.600,(SILENCE)
f001021,4681.600,4696.460,"And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity; that our schools are working; that if there's violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of control."
f001022,4696.460,4700.500,And so what I want is a -- is a comprehensive strategy.
n000475,4700.500,4701.200,(SILENCE)
f001023,4701.200,4711.360,Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.
n000476,4711.360,4711.800,(SILENCE)
f001024,4711.800,4719.340,But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.
f001025,4719.340,4724.600,"Governor Romney, the question is about assault weapons, AK-47s."
f001026,4724.600,4730.840,"Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal."
f001027,4730.840,4736.460,"We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons."
n000477,4736.460,4737.040,(SILENCE)
f001028,4737.040,4748.480,"What I believe is we have to do, as the president mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have, and to change the culture of violence that we have."
n000478,4748.480,4749.280,(SILENCE)
f001029,4749.280,4751.400,And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?
f001030,4751.400,4752.140,And there are a number of things.
f001031,4752.140,4753.240,He mentioned good schools.
f001032,4753.240,4754.040,I totally agree.
f001033,4754.040,4757.560,We were able to drive our schools to be number one in the nation in my state.

f001034,4758.120,4764.380,"And I believe if we do a better job in education, we'll -- we'll give people the -- the hope and opportunity they deserve and perhaps less violence from that."
f001035,4764.380,4766.560,But let me mention another thing.
f001036,4766.560,4767.560,And that is parents.

f001040,4777.960,4783.620,"But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea."
f001041,4783.620,4789.120,"Because if there's a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically."

f001057,4887.720,4896.600,"Well, Candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation."
f001058,4896.600,4907.360,"And it's referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted."

f001068,4931.840,4941.000,"The -- first of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it."
