f000025,123.560,125.640,I've thought a lot about what it means to be the president.
f000026,125.640,150.600,"I also understand that an administration is not one person, but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country, to serve a cause greater than self, and so I've thought about an administration of people who represent all America, but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy."

f000029,165.800,170.760,He's man of solid judgment and he's going to be a person to stand by my side.
f000030,170.760,174.600,One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.

f000031,175.600,177.160,I've been able to set clear goals.
f000032,177.160,191.560,"The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals."

f000033,192.320,194.280,That's what a Chief Executive Officer does.
f000034,194.280,198.800,So I've thought long and hard about the honor of being the President of the United States.

f000037,201.440,211.480,"I've thought a lot about that particular question, and I see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world."
n000020,211.480,212.000,(SILENCE)
f000038,212.000,214.400,I see it as a question of values.
f000039,214.400,234.540,It is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be.
f000040,234.540,240.040,And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.
f000041,240.040,244.340,"It's really true, even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us."

f000043,260.000,267.940,So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union.
f000044,267.940,273.340,The power of example is America's greatest power in the world.
f000045,273.340,275.760,"And that means, for example, standing up for human rights."
n000022,275.760,276.600,(SILENCE)
f000046,276.600,297.640,"It means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity, along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home, because in all these other places around the world where they're having these terrible problems, when they feel hope, it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential."
n000023,297.640,298.160,(SILENCE)
f000047,298.160,300.700,So we've got to enforce our civil rights laws.
f000048,300.700,303.400,We've got to deal with things like racial profiling.
n000024,303.400,304.040,(SILENCE)
f000049,304.040,305.840,And we have to keep our military strong.
f000050,305.840,312.840,"We have the strongest military, and I'll do whatever is necessary, if I'm president, to make sure that it stays that way."
n000025,312.840,313.520,(SILENCE)
f000051,313.520,316.880,"But our real power comes, I think, from our values."

f000052,318.000,328.460,"Should the people of the world look at the United States, Governor, and say, should they fear us, should they welcome our involvement, should they see us as a friend, everybody in the world?"
f000053,328.460,333.440,"How would you project us around the world, as president?"
f000054,333.440,341.880,"Well, I think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesn't matter who you are or how you're raised or where you're from, that you can succeed."
f000055,341.880,344.680,I don't think they'll look at us with envy.
n000027,344.680,345.600,(SILENCE)
f000056,345.600,349.520,It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy.
f000057,349.520,352.620,"If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us."
f000058,352.620,356.680,"If we're a humble nation, but strong, they'll welcome us."
n000028,356.680,357.280,(SILENCE)
f000059,357.280,365.760,"And it's -- our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and that's why we have to be humble."
f000060,365.760,369.320,And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom.
f000061,369.320,372.400,So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.
f000062,372.400,380.040,"We're a freedom-loving nation and if we're an arrogant nation they'll view us that way, but if we're a humble nation they'll respect us."
n000029,380.040,380.400,(SILENCE)
f000063,380.400,380.820,A humble nation.
n000030,380.820,381.280,(SILENCE)
f000064,381.280,381.920,I agree with that.
n000031,381.920,382.360,(SILENCE)
f000065,382.360,384.320,I agree with that.
f000066,384.320,400.440,"I think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history, that I know about, anyway."
n000032,400.440,400.920,(SILENCE)
f000067,400.920,405.000,That there is some resentment of U.S. power.
f000068,405.000,411.040,So I think that the idea of humility is an important one.
n000033,411.040,411.760,(SILENCE)
f000069,411.760,417.540,But I think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world.
f000070,417.540,422.000,We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about.
n000034,422.000,422.360,(SILENCE)
f000071,422.360,428.000,"That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong."
n000035,428.000,428.320,(SILENCE)
f000072,428.320,445.840,"You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time."
n000036,445.840,446.440,(SILENCE)
f000073,446.440,450.640,The fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough.
f000074,450.640,451.160,We need to do more.
f000075,451.160,459.920,But the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that America can represent.
f000076,459.920,468.980,"Does that give us -- does our wealth, our good economy, our power, bring with it special obligations to the rest of the world?"
f000077,468.980,469.800,"Yes, it does."
n000037,469.800,470.800,(SILENCE)
f000078,470.800,472.560,"Take, for example, Third World debt."
n000038,472.560,473.640,(SILENCE)
f000079,473.640,478.760,I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.
f000080,478.760,500.660,"I think, for example, if we're convinced that a Third World country that's got a lot of debt would reform itself, that the money wouldn't go into the hands of a few but would go to help people, I think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way, or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands, makes that much sense, yes."
f000081,500.660,503.900,"We do have an obligation, but we can't be all things to all people."
n000039,503.900,504.720,(SILENCE)
f000082,504.720,509.080,We can help build coalitions but we can't put our troops all around the world.

f000083,509.920,512.260,We can lend money but we have to do it wisely.
f000084,512.260,515.680,We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials.
n000041,515.680,516.520,(SILENCE)
f000085,516.520,518.600,So we got to be guarded in our generosity.

f000086,519.480,522.100,Let's go through some of the specifics now.
f000087,522.100,522.880,New question.
f000088,522.880,526.700,"Vice President Gore, the governor mentioned the Middle East."
f000089,526.700,532.920,Here we're talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have.
f000090,532.920,536.900,What do you think the United States should do right now to resolve that conflict over there?
f000091,536.900,546.520,"The first priority has to be on ending the violence, dampening down the tensions that have arisen there."
f000092,546.520,552.920,We need to call upon Syria to release the three Israeli soldiers who have been captured.
n000043,552.920,553.520,(SILENCE)
f000093,553.520,566.420,We need to insist that Arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on.
f000094,566.420,588.680,"I think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward Saddam Hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats, and he needs to understand that he's not only dealing with Israel, he is dealing -- he's dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that he's talking about there."
n000044,588.680,589.160,(SILENCE)
f000095,589.160,596.820,"The use of diplomacy in this situation has already, well, it goes hour-by-hour and day-by-day now."
f000096,596.820,598.720,It's a very tense situation there.
f000097,598.720,605.000,But in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there.
f000098,605.000,611.320,"It's too much to hope that this is going to continue, but I do hope that it will continue."
n000045,611.320,611.920,(SILENCE)
f000099,611.920,621.360,Our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there.
f000100,621.360,625.400,And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.
f000101,625.400,634.960,"But one thing I would say where diplomacy is concerned, Israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing."
n000046,634.960,635.800,(SILENCE)
f000102,635.800,645.880,Our bonds with Israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives.

f000103,646.560,649.920,"They are historic, they are strong, and they are enduring."

f000105,655.600,656.840,Governor?
f000106,656.840,666.240,"Well, I think during the campaign, particularly now during this difficult period, we ought to be speaking with one voice, and I appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions."

f000110,682.640,684.900,I'm going to stand by Israel.

n000052,693.520,694.680,(SILENCE)
f000112,694.680,700.560,It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship.

f000116,715.960,719.400,We don't know whether he's developing weapons of mass destruction.
f000117,719.400,722.440,He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.
n000054,722.440,723.080,(SILENCE)
f000118,723.080,729.000,But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination.

f000119,729.640,745.120,"One of the reasons why I think it's important for this nation to develop an anti-ballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the Middle East if need be to keep the peace to be able to say to the Saddam Husseinâ€™s of the world or the Iranians, don't dare threaten our friends."

n000058,765.580,766.960,(SILENCE)
f000123,766.960,773.840,"So you don't believe, Vice President Gore, that we should take sides and resolve this right now?"

f000125,780.560,786.960,"Well, we stand with Israel, but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker."
f000126,786.960,800.920,"And one of the reasons that's important is that Israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts, especially during times of tension, unless that dialogue comes through us."
n000059,800.920,801.480,(SILENCE)
f000127,801.480,814.180,"And if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker, then we have thrown -- we will have thrown away a strategic asset that's important not only to us but also to Israel."

f000129,815.460,815.800,I do.
f000130,815.800,817.240,"I do think this, though."
f000131,817.240,823.200,When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.
f000132,823.200,828.440,"It's got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to, like the Palestinians and Israelis."
f000133,828.440,833.400,"Secondly, any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace that's good for both sides."

f000135,836.660,842.360,This current administration's worked hard to keep the parties at the table.
f000136,842.360,844.960,I will try to do the same thing.
n000061,844.960,845.640,(SILENCE)

f000717,3700.860,3707.200,"Both of you -- Governor, both of you have talked much about Medicare and health care for seniors."
f000718,3707.200,3712.840,What about the more than 40 million younger Americans who do not have health insurance right now?

f000721,3718.040,3723.040,It's to make health care affordable and available this way.

f000725,3729.300,3734.960,"Some of the healthy folks, healthy young kids say I'll never get sick, therefore I don't need health care right now."
f000726,3734.960,3746.140,"For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity."
f000727,3746.140,3757.840,"In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do."
f000728,3757.840,3760.780,"One, we need more community health centers."
f000729,3760.780,3765.560,I've developed -- put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country.
f000730,3765.560,3768.040,These are places where people can get primary care.

n000268,3774.280,3774.720,(SILENCE)
f000733,3774.720,3786.620,"Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets."
f000734,3786.620,3790.480,It will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system.
f000735,3790.480,3801.760,"If you allow -- also allow -- convince states to -- allow states to allow the mother to match some of the children's health insurance money with it, the pool purchasing power."
f000736,3801.760,3822.320,"And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down."
f000737,3822.320,3824.620,I think that's the very best way to go.
f000738,3824.620,3831.640,"It empowers people, it trusts people, it makes -- and it's a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance."
