f000003,109.601,110.360,Thank you very much for being here.
f000004,110.360,114.060,We’re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall.
f000005,114.060,116.680,Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question.
f000006,116.680,119.240,"Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you’ll go first."
f000007,119.240,121.280,Our first question comes from Patrice Brock.
f000008,121.280,122.440,Patrice?

f000010,126.160,133.660,"The last debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines."
f000011,133.660,142.800,"Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students’ homework, do you feel you’re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today’s youth?"
f000012,142.800,145.400,"Well, thank you."
f000013,145.400,145.640,Are you a teacher?
n000003,145.640,145.960,(SILENCE)
f000014,145.960,158.320,"Yes, I think that that’s a very good question, because I’ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign."
n000004,158.320,158.880,(SILENCE)
f000015,158.880,170.060,And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we’re good.
f000016,170.060,173.960,"And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up."

f000018,190.060,194.080,I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together.
n000006,194.080,194.640,(SILENCE)
f000019,194.640,223.240,"That’s why the slogan of my campaign is ""Stronger Together,"" because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals — and I’ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else."
f000020,223.240,230.920,"If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there’s nothing in my opinion that America can’t do."
n000007,230.920,231.360,(SILENCE)
f000021,231.360,235.880,So that’s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign.

f000028,265.800,268.820,I agree with everything she said.
f000029,268.820,275.720,I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country.

f000030,276.720,277.880,This is a great country.

f000032,279.560,285.880,I’ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I’ve been doing this as a politician.

f000033,286.440,290.960,"I cannot believe I’m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician."
f000034,290.960,294.700,And my whole concept was to make America great again.
f000035,294.700,328.560,"When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what’s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it’s a one-sided transaction where we’re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we’ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago."
f000036,328.560,339.600,"When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it’s in business and trade, where we’re doing so badly."
f000037,339.600,343.860,"Last year, we had almost $800 billion trade deficit."
f000038,343.860,346.120,"In other words, trading with other countries."
f000039,346.120,349.740,We had an $800 billion deficit.
f000040,349.740,350.660,It’s hard to believe.
f000041,350.660,351.460,Inconceivable.
n000016,351.460,352.080,(SILENCE)
f000042,352.080,353.940,You say who’s making these deals?
f000043,353.940,355.380,We’re going the make great deals.
f000044,355.380,356.000,We’re going to have a strong border.
f000045,356.000,358.360,We’re going to bring back law and order.

n000019,365.520,366.120,(SILENCE)
f000048,366.120,369.820,We have to bring back respect to law enforcement.

f000051,374.520,387.960,"But I want to do things that haven’t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it."
f000052,387.960,391.280,It’s called make America great again.
f000053,391.280,391.880,"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
n000021,391.880,392.600,(SILENCE)
f000054,392.600,397.560,The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today’s youth?
f000055,397.560,402.840,"We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine."
n000022,402.840,403.360,(SILENCE)
f000056,403.360,405.480,You called what you said locker room banter.

f000057,405.840,408.880,"You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals."

n000024,410.400,411.040,(SILENCE)
f000059,411.040,412.940,You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women.

f000061,414.800,415.880,"No, I didn’t say that at all."
f000062,415.880,419.720,I don’t think you understood what was — this was locker room talk.
f000063,419.720,421.980,I’m not proud of it.
f000064,421.980,423.360,I apologize to my family.
f000065,423.360,425.080,I apologize to the American people.
f000066,425.080,427.200,Certainly I’m not proud of it.
f000067,427.200,428.820,But this is locker room talk.
f000068,428.820,444.380,"You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have — and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times."
f000069,444.380,447.960,"We haven’t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world."
f000070,447.960,449.580,And they look and they see.
f000071,449.580,455.960,"Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS?"
n000027,455.960,456.280,(SILENCE)
f000072,456.280,458.440,And they look at our country and they see what’s going on.
f000073,458.440,459.980,"Yes, I’m very embarrassed by it."
f000074,459.980,460.820,I hate it.
f000075,460.820,464.700,"But it’s locker room talk, and it’s one of those things."
f000076,464.700,467.200,I will knock the hell out of ISIS.
f000077,467.200,468.840,We’re going to defeat ISIS.
f000078,468.840,475.060,ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment.
f000079,475.060,478.260,"And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS."
f000080,478.260,478.800,"So, Mr. Trump..."
f000081,478.800,482.820,And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things.
f000082,482.820,491.480,"Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent?"

f000087,501.180,502.760,And I was embarrassed by it.
n000030,502.760,503.200,(SILENCE)
f000088,503.200,504.920,But I have tremendous respect for women.
f000089,504.920,506.180,Have you ever done those things?
f000090,506.180,507.260,And women have respect for me.
f000091,507.260,509.220,"And I will tell you: No, I have not."
f000092,509.220,512.700,And I will tell you that I’m going to make our country safe.
f000093,512.700,515.560,"We’re going to have borders in our country, which we don’t have now."
f000094,515.560,520.020,"People are pouring into our country, and they’re coming in from the Middle East and other places."

f000098,533.920,534.480,"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
f000099,534.480,536.320,"Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they’re taking our wealth."
f000100,536.320,537.340,"Thank you, Mr. Trump."
f000101,537.340,538.700,And that’s what I want to talk about.

f000118,660.480,662.240,So this is who Donald Trump is.

f000152,822.900,825.280,That was locker room talk.
f000153,825.280,825.920,I’m not proud of it.

f000161,849.640,855.960,"So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women."

f000190,1071.820,1073.800,So you really owe him an apology.
f000191,1073.800,1079.960,"You’re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb."
f000192,1079.960,1084.100,"That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology."

f000222,1232.840,1239.060,I’d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we’re going to really make lives better for people.
f000223,1239.060,1242.480,"So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com."
f000224,1242.480,1247.940,We have literally Trump — you can fact check him in real time.
f000225,1247.940,1262.180,"Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we’ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is — it’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country."
f000226,1262.180,1262.520,Because you’d be in jail.
f000227,1262.520,1262.521,(APPLAUSE)
f000228,1262.521,1263.800,Secretary Clinton...
f000229,1263.800,1274.080,We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud.
f000230,1274.080,1277.080,Please do not applaud.
f000231,1277.080,1278.480,You’re just wasting time.
f000232,1278.480,1282.440,"And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails."
f000233,1282.440,1285.420,You’ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake.
f000234,1285.420,1292.960,"You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, ""extremely careless."""

f000235,1293.360,1303.320,"The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails."
f000236,1303.320,1306.740,You don’t call that extremely careless?
f000237,1306.740,1318.340,"Well, Martha, first, let me say — and I’ve said before, but I’ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it — that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account."
f000238,1318.340,1321.300,"Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not."
f000239,1321.300,1322.960,I’m not making any excuses.
f000240,1322.960,1324.760,It was a mistake.
f000241,1324.760,1327.060,And I am very sorry about that.
f000242,1327.060,1338.120,But I think it’s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others.
f000243,1338.120,1358.000,"After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all — anyone who says otherwise has no basis — that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands."
f000244,1358.000,1362.560,I take classified materials very seriously and always have.
f000245,1362.560,1367.360,"When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material."
n000085,1367.360,1367.840,(SILENCE)
f000246,1367.840,1378.000,"Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden."
f000247,1378.000,1382.980,So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously.
f000248,1382.980,1388.800,"And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands."
f000249,1388.800,1389.860,"OK, we’re going to move on."
f000250,1389.860,1394.460,And yet she didn’t know the word — the letter C on a document.
n000086,1394.460,1395.440,(SILENCE)
f000251,1395.440,1395.740,Right?
f000252,1395.740,1399.140,She didn’t even know what that word — what that letter meant.
f000253,1399.140,1400.040,"You know, it’s amazing."
f000254,1400.040,1402.200,I’m watching Hillary go over facts.
n000087,1402.200,1402.840,(SILENCE)
f000255,1402.840,1409.920,"And she’s going after fact after fact, and she’s lying again, because she said she — you know, what she did with the e-mail was fine."
f000256,1409.920,1411.840,"You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails?"
f000257,1411.840,1412.920,I don’t think so.
f000258,1412.920,1419.400,"She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter’s wedding, number one, and a yoga class."
f000259,1419.400,1422.760,"Well, maybe we’ll give three or three or four or five or something."
f000260,1422.760,1426.900,"33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she’s saying there wasn’t anything wrong."
f000261,1426.900,1429.460,"And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena."
f000262,1429.460,1430.380,That wasn’t before.
f000263,1430.380,1431.320,That was after.
f000264,1431.320,1433.280,She got it from the United States Congress.
f000265,1433.280,1442.200,"And I’ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen."
f000266,1442.200,1451.420,"Our Justice Department, where our husband goes on to the back of a airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case."
f000267,1451.420,1461.400,"But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself."
f000268,1461.400,1466.160,What you did — and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
f000269,1466.160,1466.720,We have to move on.
f000270,1466.720,1467.240,You did that.
f000271,1467.240,1467.560,Wait a minute.
f000272,1467.560,1468.320,One second.
f000273,1468.320,1470.580,"Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we got to move on."
f000274,1470.580,1471.220,We want to give the audience a chance.
f000275,1471.220,1474.880,"If you did that in the private sector, you’d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress."
f000276,1474.880,1475.780,"Secretary Clinton, you can respond."
f000277,1475.780,1477.240,Then we have to move on to an audience question.
n000088,1477.240,1477.600,(SILENCE)
f000278,1477.600,1479.980,"Look, it’s just not true."

f000280,1481.320,1482.040,"Oh, you didn’t delete them?"
f000281,1482.040,1482.920,"Allow her to respond, please."
f000282,1482.920,1484.600,"It was personal e-mails, not official."
f000283,1484.600,1485.940,"Oh, 33,000?"
f000284,1485.940,1486.320,Yeah.
f000285,1486.320,1488.780,"Not — well, we turned over 35,000, so..."
f000286,1488.780,1489.360,"Oh, yeah."
f000287,1489.360,1491.040,"What about the other 15,000?"
f000288,1491.040,1492.040,Please allow her to respond.
f000289,1492.040,1492.960,She didn’t talk while you talked.

f000291,1494.860,1496.020,Because you have nothing to say.
f000292,1496.020,1505.460,"I didn’t in the first debate, and I’m going to try not to in this debate, because I’d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about."
f000293,1505.460,1506.600,Get off this question.
n000090,1506.600,1509.040,(SILENCE)
f000294,1509.040,1509.800,"OK, Donald."

f000296,1517.980,1519.320,But let’s at least focus...
f000297,1519.320,1520.280,Let’s see what happens...
f000298,1520.280,1520.281,(CROSSTALK)
f000299,1520.281,1521.600,Allow her to respond.

f000301,1523.460,1524.760,Let’s get to their questions.
f000302,1524.760,1526.760,We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz.

f000306,1531.340,1532.040,I’d like to know.
f000307,1532.040,1532.760,Why aren’t you bringing...
f000308,1532.760,1533.620,We brought up the e-mails.
f000309,1533.620,1534.220,"No, it hasn’t."
f000310,1534.220,1534.840,It hasn’t.

f001136,4843.680,4848.440,Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice.

f001141,4858.780,4863.300,This is one of the most important issues in this election.
f001142,4863.300,4883.060,"I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against."
f001143,4883.060,4885.840,Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction.

f001238,5318.760,5321.440,But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices.
f001239,5321.440,5324.240,So the price of oil has been way down.
f001240,5324.240,5328.360,"And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right?"
n000360,5328.360,5329.280,(SILENCE)
f001241,5329.280,5335.840,"We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels."
f001242,5335.840,5339.880,And I think that’s an important transition.
f001243,5339.880,5342.160,We’ve got to remain energy-independent.
f001244,5342.160,5348.100,It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East.
f001245,5348.100,5351.400,We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that.
n000361,5351.400,5352.080,(SILENCE)
f001246,5352.080,5360.920,"So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem."
f001247,5360.920,5375.140,"And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses."
n000362,5375.140,5375.680,(SILENCE)
f001248,5375.680,5378.580,But I also want to be sure that we don’t leave people behind.
f001249,5378.580,5392.240,"That’s why I’m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out."
f001250,5392.240,5394.160,A lot of them lost their lives.
f001251,5394.160,5398.080,"They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered their factories."
f001252,5398.080,5399.300,I don’t want to walk away from them.
f001253,5399.300,5401.020,So we’ve got to do something for them.
f001254,5401.020,5401.720,Secretary Clinton...
f001255,5401.720,5404.140,But the price of coal is down worldwide.
f001256,5404.140,5406.040,So we have to look at this comprehensively.
f001257,5406.040,5406.440,Your time is up.
f001258,5406.440,5408.000,And that’s exactly what I have proposed.
f001259,5408.000,5410.880,I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy.
f001260,5410.880,5411.620,Time is up.
f001261,5411.620,5412.400,We have time for one more...
f001262,5412.400,5412.640,We have...
f001263,5412.640,5413.580,One more audience question.
f001264,5413.580,5423.540,"We’ve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker."
f001265,5423.540,5424.160,Good evening.
f001266,5424.160,5435.880,"My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another?"
f001267,5435.880,5435.881,(APPLAUSE)
f001268,5435.881,5440.880,"Mr. Trump, would you like to go first?"
f001269,5440.880,5453.740,"Well, I certainly will, because I think that’s a very fair and important question."
n000363,5453.740,5454.200,(SILENCE)
f001270,5454.200,5456.560,"Look, I respect his children."

f001271,5457.760,5465.000,"His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald."
n000365,5465.000,5465.720,(SILENCE)
f001272,5465.720,5471.680,"I don’t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that."
f001273,5471.680,5478.260,And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me.
f001274,5478.260,5492.440,"So I believe that this election has become in part so — so conflict-oriented, so intense because there’s a lot at stake."
n000366,5492.440,5493.400,(SILENCE)
f001275,5493.400,5497.600,"This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election."
n000367,5497.600,5498.520,(SILENCE)
f001276,5498.520,5516.580,"We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake."
f001277,5516.580,5520.540,It’s one of the most consequential elections that we’ve had.
f001278,5520.540,5529.380,"And that’s why I’ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president."
n000368,5529.380,5529.960,(SILENCE)
f001279,5529.960,5541.920,"And that’s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I’ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families."
f001280,5541.920,5545.920,And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day.
n000369,5545.920,5546.920,(SILENCE)
f001281,5546.920,5547.400,Mr. Trump?
n000370,5547.400,5548.840,(SILENCE)
f001282,5548.840,5553.880,"Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment."
f001283,5553.880,5559.840,"I don’t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great — I’m very proud of my children."
n000371,5559.840,5560.160,(SILENCE)
f001284,5560.160,5563.560,"And they’ve done a wonderful job, and they’ve been wonderful, wonderful kids."
f001285,5563.560,5566.620,So I consider that a compliment.
f001286,5566.620,5568.320,I will say this about Hillary.
f001287,5568.320,5569.920,She doesn’t quit.
n000372,5569.920,5570.280,(SILENCE)
f001288,5570.280,5571.040,She doesn’t give up.
n000373,5571.040,5571.600,(SILENCE)
f001289,5571.600,5573.320,I respect that.
f001290,5573.320,5574.200,I tell it like it is.
n000374,5574.200,5574.840,(SILENCE)
f001291,5574.840,5575.560,She’s a fighter.
n000375,5575.560,5576.520,(SILENCE)
f001292,5576.520,5579.240,I disagree with much of what she’s fighting for.
n000376,5579.240,5580.040,(SILENCE)
f001293,5580.040,5583.640,I do disagree with her judgment in many cases.
n000377,5583.640,5584.400,(SILENCE)
f001294,5584.400,5588.040,"But she does fight hard, and she doesn’t quit, and she doesn’t give up."
f001295,5588.040,5590.520,And I consider that to be a very good trait.
n000378,5590.520,5590.960,(SILENCE)
f001296,5590.960,5592.440,Thanks to both of you.
f001297,5592.440,5595.800,We want to thank both the candidates.
f001298,5595.800,5598.200,We want to thank the university here.
f001299,5598.200,5599.800,This concludes the town hall meeting.
f001300,5599.800,5603.480,"Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched."
