HEAD,0.000,7.000,
f000001,7.000,8.780,Good evening.
f000002,8.780,19.380,"From Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, and welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2016, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates."
f000003,19.380,24.160,"I’m Elaine Quijano, anchor at CBSN, and correspondent for CBS News."
n000001,24.160,24.520,(SILENCE)
f000004,24.520,30.100,It’s an honor to moderate this debate between Senator Tim Kaine and Governor Mike Pence.
f000005,30.100,36.600,Both are longtime public servants who are also proud fathers of sons serving in the U.S. Marines.
n000002,36.600,37.400,(SILENCE)
f000006,37.400,40.520,The campaigns have agreed to the rules of this 90-minute debate.
f000007,40.520,45.080,There will be nine different segments covering domestic and foreign policy issues.
f000008,45.080,50.400,Each segment will begin with a question to both candidates who will each have two minutes to answer.
f000009,50.400,55.460,Then I’ll ask follow-up questions to facilitate a discussion between the candidates.
f000010,55.460,61.540,"By coin toss, it’s been determined that Senator Kaine will be first to answer the opening question."
f000011,61.540,64.320,We have an enthusiastic audience tonight.
f000012,64.320,92.280,They’ve agreed to only express that enthusiasm once at the end of the debate and right now as we welcome Governor Mike Pence and Senator Tim Kaine.
f000013,92.280,92.281,[applause]
f000014,92.281,99.700,"Gentlemen, welcome."
f000015,99.700,102.900,It truly is a privilege to be with both of you tonight.
f000016,102.900,105.960,I’d like to start with the topic of presidential leadership.
n000003,105.960,106.320,(SILENCE)
f000017,106.320,126.820,"Twenty-eight years ago tomorrow night, Lloyd Bentsen said the vice presidential debate was not about the qualifications for the vice presidency, but about how if tragedy should occur, the vice president has to step in without any margin for error, without time for preparation, to take over the responsibility for the biggest job in the world."
f000018,126.820,134.960,"What about your qualities, your skills, and your temperament equip you to step into that role at a moment’s notice?"
f000019,134.960,136.440,Senator Kaine?
f000020,136.440,139.160,"Elaine, thank you for being here tonight, and, Governor Pence, welcome."
f000021,139.160,143.600,"It is so great to be back at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia."
f000022,143.600,144.840,This is a very special place.
n000004,144.840,145.400,(SILENCE)
f000023,145.400,152.920,"Sixty-five years ago, a young, courageous woman, Barbara Johns, led a walkout of her high school, Moton High School."
n000005,152.920,153.480,(SILENCE)
f000024,153.480,156.280,She made history by protesting school segregation.
n000006,156.280,156.840,(SILENCE)
f000025,156.840,160.000,She believed our nation was stronger together.
f000026,160.000,165.720,And that walkout led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision that moved us down the path toward equality.
n000007,165.720,166.240,(SILENCE)
f000027,166.240,173.080,"I am so proud to be running with another strong, history-making woman, Hillary Clinton, to be president of the United States."
n000008,173.080,173.600,(SILENCE)
f000028,173.600,193.240,"I’m proud because her vision of stronger together, building an economy that works for all, not just those at the top, being safe in the world not only with a strong military, but also strong alliances to battle terrorism and climate change, and also to build a community of respect, just like Barbara Johns tried to do 65 years ago."
f000029,193.240,195.300,That’s why I’m so proud to be her running mate.
f000030,195.300,198.380,Hillary told me why she asked me to be her running mate.
f000031,198.380,204.180,She said the test of a Clinton administration will not be the signing of a bill or the passage of a bill.
f000032,204.180,215.660,"It’ll be whether we can make somebody’s life better, whether we can make a classroom better learning environment for schoolkids or teachers, whether we can make a safer — it’s going to be about results."
f000033,215.660,219.160,"And she said to me, you’ve been a missionary and a civil rights lawyer."
n000009,219.160,219.560,(SILENCE)
f000034,219.560,220.880,You’ve been a city councilman and mayor.
f000035,220.880,224.880,You’ve been a lieutenant governor and governor and now a U.S. senator.
f000036,224.880,234.980,I think you will help me figure out how to govern this nation so that we always keep in mind that the success of the administration is the difference we make in people’s lives.
f000037,234.980,239.740,"And that’s what I bring to the ticket, that experience having served at all levels of government."
f000038,239.740,248.440,But my primary role is to be Hillary Clinton’s right-hand person and strong supporter as she puts together the most historic administration possible.
f000039,248.440,249.400,And I relish that role.
f000040,249.400,250.360,I’m so proud of her.
f000041,250.360,256.040,"I’ll just say this: We trust Hillary Clinton, my wife and I, and we trust her with the most important thing in our life."
f000042,256.040,258.980,We have a son deployed overseas in the Marine Corps right now.
f000043,258.980,266.220,"We trust Hillary Clinton as president and commander-in-chief, but the thought of Donald Trump as commander-in-chief scares us to death."
f000044,266.220,267.880,Governor Pence?
f000045,267.880,275.320,"Well, first off, thank you, Elaine, and thank you to — thank you to Norwood University for their wonderful hospitality and the Commission on Presidential Debates."
f000046,275.320,280.480,"It’s deeply humbling for me to be here, to be surrounded by my — my wonderful family."
f000047,280.480,284.360,"And, Senator Kaine, it’s an honor to be here with you, as well."
n000010,284.360,284.800,(SILENCE)
f000048,284.800,295.680,"And I just — I also want to say — I want to say thanks to everyone that’s looking in tonight, who understands what an enormously important time this is in the life of our nation."
f000049,295.680,300.900,"For the last seven-and-a-half years, we’ve seen America’s place in the world weakened."
f000050,300.900,313.060,"We’ve seen an economy stifled by more taxes, more regulation, a war on coal, and a failing health care reform come to be known as Obamacare, and the American people know that we need to make a change."
f000051,313.060,316.760,And so I want to thank all of you for being — being with us tonight.
f000052,316.760,322.960,I also want to thank Donald Trump for making that call and inviting us to be a part of this ticket.
f000053,322.960,326.480,"I have to tell you, I’m a — I’m a small-town boy from a place not too different from Farmville."
n000011,326.480,326.880,(SILENCE)
f000054,326.880,329.460,I grew up with a cornfield in my backyard.
f000055,329.460,333.040,My grandfather had immigrated to this country when he was about my son’s age.
n000012,333.040,333.680,(SILENCE)
f000056,333.680,338.840,My mom and dad built a — everything that matters in a small town in Southern Indiana.
f000057,338.840,342.200,They built a family and — and a good name and a business.
f000058,342.200,344.140,And they raised a family.
f000059,344.140,358.240,"And I dreamed some day of representing my home town in Washington, D.C., but I — honestly, Elaine, I never imagined — never imagined I’d have the opportunity to be governor of the state that I love, let alone be sitting at a table like this in this kind of a position."
f000060,358.240,373.680,"So to answer your question, I would say I — I would hope that if — if the responsibility ever fell to me in this role, that I would meet it with the way that I’m going to meet the responsibility should I be elected vice president of the United States."
f000061,373.680,395.700,"And that’s to bring a lifetime of experience, a lifetime growing up in a small town, a lifetime where I’ve served in the Congress of the United States, where — where I’ve led a state that works in the great state of Indiana, and whatever other responsibilities might follow from this, I — I would hope and, frankly, I would pray to be able to meet that moment with that — that lifetime of experience."
f000062,395.700,406.660,"Senator Kaine, on the campaign trail, you praised Secretary Clinton’s character, including her commitment to public service, yet 60 percent of voters don’t think she’s trustworthy."
f000063,406.660,408.940,Why do so many people distrust her?
f000064,408.940,413.480,Is it because they have questions about her e-mails and the Clinton Foundation?
f000065,413.480,415.540,"Elaine, let me tell you why I trust Hillary Clinton."
f000066,415.540,418.720,Here’s what people should look at as they look at a public servant.
n000013,418.720,419.320,(SILENCE)
f000067,419.320,423.740,Do they have a passion in their life that showed up before they were in public life?
f000068,423.740,430.640,"And have they held onto that passion throughout their life, regardless of whether they were in office or not, succeeding or failing?"
n000014,430.640,431.080,(SILENCE)
f000069,431.080,432.740,Hillary Clinton has that passion.
f000070,432.740,442.560,"From a time as a kid in a Methodist youth group in the suburbs of Chicago, she has been focused on serving others with a special focus on empowering families and kids."
f000071,442.560,452.640,"As a civil rights lawyer in the South, with the Children’s Defense Fund, first lady of Arkansas and this country, senator, secretary of state, it’s always been about putting others first."
f000072,452.640,455.400,And that’s a sharp contrast with Donald Trump.
f000073,455.400,457.920,Donald Trump always puts himself first.
f000074,457.920,463.620,"He built a business career, in the words of one of his own campaign staffers, ""off the backs of the little guy."""
f000075,463.620,477.660,"And as a candidate, he started his campaign with a speech where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals, and he has pursued the discredited and really outrageous lie that President Obama wasn’t born in the United States."
f000076,477.660,485.960,It is so painful to suggest that we go back to think about these days where an African-American could not be a citizen of the United States.
f000077,485.960,492.000,"And I can’t imagine how Governor Pence can defend the insult-driven selfish ""me first"" style of Donald Trump."
f000078,492.000,497.460,"Governor Pence, let me ask you, you have said Donald Trump is, quote, ""thoughtful, compassionate, and steady."""
f000079,497.460,505.940,"Yet 67 percent of voters feel he is a risky choice, and 65 percent feel he does not have the right kind of temperament to be president."
f000080,505.940,509.680,Why do so many Americans think Mr. Trump is simply too erratic?
f000081,509.680,516.800,"Well, let me — let me say first and foremost that, Senator, you and Hillary Clinton would know a lot about an insult-driven campaign."
n000015,516.800,517.680,(SILENCE)
f000082,517.680,519.920,It really is remarkable.
f000083,519.920,533.560,"At a time when literally, in the wake of Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, where she was the architect of the Obama administration’s foreign policy, we see entire portions of the world, particularly the wider Middle East, literally spinning out of control."
n000016,533.560,534.240,(SILENCE)
f000084,534.240,545.480,"I mean, the situation we’re watching hour by hour in Syria today is the result of the failed foreign policy and the weak foreign policy that Hillary Clinton helped lead in this administration and create."
f000085,545.480,550.920,"The newly emboldened — the aggression of Russia, whether it was in Ukraine or now their heavy-handed approach…"
f000086,550.920,551.480,You guys love Russia.
f000087,551.480,552.660,You both have said…
f000088,552.660,553.760,… their heavy-handed approach.
f000089,553.760,555.600,You both have said — you both have said Vladimir Putin is a better leader than the president.
f000090,555.600,555.840,Well…[crosstalk]
f000091,555.840,557.960,"Well, we’re going to get to Russia in just a moment."
f000092,557.960,560.840,But I do want to get back to the question at…
f000093,560.840,562.120,"But in the midst — Elaine, thank you."
f000094,562.120,562.480,Thank you.
f000095,562.480,563.520,"Thank you, Senator, I’ll…"
f000096,563.520,565.280,These guys have praised Vladimir Putin as a great leader.
f000097,565.280,565.560,How can that…[crosstalk]
f000098,565.560,567.160,"Yes, and we will get to that, Senator."
f000099,567.160,568.980,We do have that coming up here.
f000100,568.980,570.880,"But in the meantime, the questions…"
f000101,570.880,573.520,"Well, Senator, I must have hit a…[crosstalk]…I must have hit a nerve here."
f000102,573.520,574.660,Why the disconnect?
f000103,574.660,586.240,"Because at a time of great challenge in the life of this nation, where we’ve weakened America’s place in the world, stifled America’s economy, the campaign of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine has been an avalanche of insults."
f000104,586.240,594.000,"Look, to get to your question about trustworthiness, Donald Trump has built a business through hard times and through good times."
f000105,594.000,596.720,He’s brought an extraordinary business acumen.
f000106,596.720,600.360,He’s employed tens of thousands of people in this country.
f000107,600.360,603.600,And paid few taxes and lost a billion a year.
f000108,603.600,603.601,[crosstalk]
f000109,603.601,606.100,And why the disconnect with your running mate?
f000110,606.100,611.260,But there’s a — there’s a reason why people question the trustworthiness of Hillary Clinton.
f000111,611.260,612.840,And that’s because they’re paying attention.
n000017,612.840,613.720,(SILENCE)
f000112,613.720,617.640,"I mean, the reality is, when she was secretary of state, Senator, come on."
f000113,617.640,622.520,She had a Clinton Foundation accepting contributions from foreign governments.
f000114,622.520,625.280,You are Donald Trump’s apprentice.
f000115,625.280,626.880,Let me talk about this…[crosstalk]
f000116,626.880,628.640,"Senator, I think I’m still on my time."
f000117,628.640,630.200,"Well, I think — isn’t this a discussion?"
f000118,630.200,631.320,This is our open discussion.
f000119,631.320,633.080,"Yeah, let’s talk about the state of…[crosstalk]"
f000120,633.080,636.160,"Well, let me interrupt — let me interrupt you and finish my sentence, if I can."
f000121,636.160,637.120,Finish your sentence.
f000122,637.120,644.440,The Clinton Foundation accepted foreign contributions from foreign governments and foreign donors while she was secretary of state.
f000123,644.440,645.200,"OK, now I can weigh in."
f000124,645.200,645.440,Now…
f000125,645.440,646.440,She had a private server…
f000126,646.440,647.520,"Now, I get to weigh in."
f000127,647.520,647.920,"Now, let me just say this…"
f000128,647.920,648.560,… that was discovered…[crosstalk]
f000129,648.560,649.560,"… Senator, you have an opportunity to respond."
f000130,649.560,652.440,… keep that pay to play process out of the reach of the public.
f000131,652.440,657.680,"Governor Pence — Governor Pence doesn’t think the world’s going so well and he, you know, is going to say it’s everybody’s fault."
f000132,657.680,658.380,Do you?
f000133,658.380,659.380,Let me tell you this.
f000134,659.380,663.880,"When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Governor Pence, do you know that Osama bin Laden was alive?"
f000135,663.880,664.520,Yes.
f000136,664.520,669.580,"Do you know that we had 175,000 troops deployed in the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan?"
f000137,669.580,674.520,Do you know that Iran was racing toward a nuclear weapon and Russia was expanding its stockpile?
f000138,674.520,684.500,"Under Secretary Clinton’s leadership, she was part of the national team, public safety team that went after and revived the dormant hunt against bin Laden and wiped him off the face of the Earth."
f000139,684.500,688.280,She worked to deal with the Russians to reduce their chemical weapons stockpile.
f000140,688.280,697.440,She worked a tough negotiation with nations around the world to eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program without firing a shot.
f000141,697.440,699.320,Eliminate the Iranian nuclear weapons program?
f000142,699.320,701.480,"Absolutely, without firing a shot."
f000143,701.480,706.240,"And instead of 175,000 American troops deployed overseas, we now have 15,000."
f000144,706.240,706.800,Right and…
f000145,706.800,708.280,"These are very, very good things."
f000146,708.280,711.480,"And Iraq has been overrun by ISIS, because Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate…"
f000147,711.480,715.360,"Well, if you want to put more American troops in Iraq, you can propose that."
f000148,715.360,718.720,Hillary Clinton — Hillary Clinton — Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement…
f000149,718.720,719.200,"No, that is incorrect."
f000150,719.200,719.840,That’s incorrect.
f000151,719.840,722.160,And so we removed — we removed all of our…
f000152,722.160,723.160,"Gentlemen, we’ll get to…[crosstalk]"
f000153,723.160,725.680,"… troops from Iraq, and ISIS was able to be conjured up in that vacuum."
f000154,725.680,726.260,But I’d like to correct…
f000155,726.260,727.800,… and overrun vast areas of Iraq.
f000156,727.800,732.920,"Governor, President Bush said we would leave Iraq at the end of 2011."
f000157,732.920,738.240,"And, Elaine, Iraq didn’t want our troops to stay, and they wouldn’t give us the protection for our troops."
f000158,738.240,739.100,And guess what?
f000159,739.100,744.600,"If a nation where our troops are serving does not want us to stay, we’re not going to stay without their protection."
f000160,744.600,745.760,It was a failure of the secretary of state…
f000161,745.760,746.640,"We need to move on to the next topic, gentlemen."
f000162,746.640,749.120,"If Governor Pence wants to put more troops back in Iraq, that’s…"
f000163,749.120,751.200,There are a lot of people wondering in this country about the economy.
f000164,751.200,753.460,Let’s turn to the issue of the economy.
f000165,753.460,753.880,OK.
f000166,753.880,764.020,"According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, neither of your economic plans will reduce the growing $19 trillion gross national debt."
f000167,764.020,767.820,"In fact, your plans would add even more to it."
f000168,767.820,771.400,Both of you were governors who balanced state budgets.
f000169,771.400,775.480,Are you concerned that adding more to the debt could be disastrous for the country.
n000018,775.480,775.880,(SILENCE)
f000170,775.880,776.120,Governor Pence?
f000171,776.120,786.680,"I think the fact that — that under this past administration of which Hillary Clinton was a part, we’ve almost doubled the national debt is atrocious."
n000019,786.680,787.400,(SILENCE)
f000172,787.400,790.080,"I mean, I’m very proud of the fact that — I come from a state that works."
f000173,790.080,792.760,The state of Indiana has balanced budgets.
f000174,792.760,799.940,"We cut taxes, we’ve made record investments in education and in infrastructure, and I still finish my term with $2 billion in the bank."
f000175,799.940,804.740,That’s a little bit different than when Senator Kaine was governor here in Virginia.
f000176,804.740,808.240,He actually — he actually tried to raise taxes by about $4 billion.
f000177,808.240,810.560,He left his state about $2 billion in the hole.
f000178,810.560,816.740,"In the state of Indiana, we’ve cut unemployment in half; unemployment doubled when he was governor."
f000179,816.740,837.620,"But I think he’s a very fitting running mate for Hillary Clinton, because in the wake of a season where American families are struggling in this economy under the weight of higher taxes and Obamacare and the war on coal and the stifling avalanche of regulation coming out of this administration, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want more of the same."
f000180,837.620,843.980,"It really is remarkable that they actually are advocating a trillion dollars in tax increases, which I get that."
f000181,843.980,846.420,You tried to raise taxes here in Virginia and were unsuccessful.
f000182,846.420,858.480,"But a trillion dollars in tax increases, more regulation, more of the same war on coal, and more of Obamacare that now even former President Bill Clinton calls Obamacare a crazy plan."
n000020,858.480,859.200,(SILENCE)
f000183,859.200,861.920,But Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine want to build on Obamacare.
f000184,861.920,865.140,They want to expand it into a single-payer program.
f000185,865.140,868.020,"And for all the world, Hillary Clinton just thinks Obamacare is a good start."
f000186,868.020,896.980,"Look, Donald Trump and I have a plan to get this economy moving again just the way that it worked in the 1980s, just the way it worked in the 1960s, and that is by lowering taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms, ending the war on coal that is hurting jobs and hurting this economy even here in Virginia, repealing Obamacare lock, stock, and barrel, and repealing all of the executive orders that Barack Obama has signed that are stifling economic growth in this economy."
f000187,896.980,898.920,We can get America moving again.
f000188,898.920,905.760,"Put on top of that the kind of trade deals that’ll put the American worker first, and you’ve got a prescription for real growth."
f000189,905.760,910.680,"And when you get the economy growing, Elaine, that’s when you can deal with the national debt."
f000190,910.680,923.440,"When we get back to 3.5 percent to 4 percent growth with Donald Trump’s plan will do, then we’re going to have the resources to meet our nation’s needs at home and abroad, and we’re going to have the ability to bring down the national debt."
f000191,923.440,924.560,Senator Kaine?
f000192,924.560,927.960,"Elaine, on the economy, there’s a fundamental choice for the American electorate."
f000193,927.960,933.640,"Do you want a ""you’re hired"" president in Hillary Clinton or do you want a ""you’re fired"" president in Donald Trump?"
f000194,933.640,935.340,I think that’s not such a hard choice.
f000195,935.340,938.720,"Hillary and I have a plan that’s on the table that’s a ""you’re hired"" plan."
n000021,938.720,939.120,(SILENCE)
f000196,939.120,940.160,Five components.
f000197,940.160,946.500,"First thing we do is we invest in manufacturing, infrastructure, and research in the clean energy jobs of tomorrow."
f000198,946.500,957.880,"Second thing is we invest in our workforce, from pre-K education to great teachers to debt-free college and tuition-free college for families that make less than $125,000 a year."
f000199,957.880,966.440,"Third, we promote fairness by raising the minimum wage, so you can’t work full-time and be under the poverty level, and by paying women equal pay for equal work."
f000200,966.440,972.800,"Fourth, we promote small business growth, just as we’ve done in Virginia, to make it easier to start and grow small businesses."
f000201,972.800,975.360,Hillary and I each grew up in small-business families.
f000202,975.360,978.560,"My dad, who ran an iron working and welding shop, is here tonight."
f000203,978.560,989.160,"And, fifth, we have a tax plan that targets tax relief to middle- class individuals and small businesses and asks those at the very top who’ve benefited as we’ve come out of recession to pay more."
f000204,989.160,991.380,The Trump plan is a different plan.
f000205,991.380,992.440,"It’s a ""you’re fired"" plan."
f000206,992.440,994.560,And there’s two key elements to it.
f000207,994.560,997.900,"First, Donald Trump said wages are too high."
f000208,997.900,1003.040,And both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage.
f000209,1003.040,1008.700,"Mike Pence, when he was in Congress, voted against raising the minimum wage above $5.15."
f000210,1008.700,1014.460,And he has been a one-man bulwark against minimum wage increases in Indiana.
f000211,1014.460,1024.340,"The second component of the plan is massive tax breaks for the very top, trillions of dollars of tax breaks for people just like Donald Trump."
f000212,1024.340,1034.140,"The problem with this, Elaine, is that’s exactly what we did 10 years ago and it put the economy into the deepest recession — the deepest recession since the 1930s."
f000213,1034.140,1038.480,Independent analysts say the Clinton plan would grow the economy by 10.5 million jobs.
f000214,1038.480,1041.440,The Trump plan would cost 3.5 million jobs.
f000215,1041.440,1043.200,And Donald Trump — why would he do this?
n000022,1043.200,1043.560,(SILENCE)
f000216,1043.560,1045.600,Because his tax plan basically helps him.
f000217,1045.600,1056.080,"And if he ever met his promise and he gave his tax returns to the American public like he said he would, we would see just how much his economic plan is really a Trump-first plan."
f000218,1056.080,1066.800,"On that point, Governor Pence, recently the New York Times released part of Mr. Trump’s 1995 tax return and reported that he could have avoided paying federal income taxes for years."
f000219,1066.800,1073.300,"Yesterday, Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible."

f000221,1076.120,1081.420,"Well, first, let me say, I appreciated the ""you’re hired,"" ""you’re fired"" thing, Senator."
f000222,1081.420,1082.700,You use that a whole lot.
f000223,1082.700,1086.400,And I think your running mate used a lot of pre-done lines.
f000224,1086.400,1098.100,"Look, what — what you all just heard out there is more taxes, $2 trillion in more spending, more deficits, more debt, more government."
f000225,1098.100,1103.400,"And if you think that’s all working, then you look at the other side of the table."
f000226,1103.400,1111.000,"I mean, the truth of the matter is, the policies of this administration, which Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine want to continue, have run this economy into a ditch."

f000239,1139.960,1143.320,The answer to this economy is not more taxes.
f000240,1143.320,1146.120,But it’s not the giveaway tax relief to the folks at the top.
f000241,1146.120,1147.000,It’s not more spending…[crosstalk]
f000242,1147.000,1151.860,I am interested to hear whether he’ll defend his running mate’s not releasing taxes and not paying taxes.
f000243,1151.860,1152.360,Absolutely I will.
f000244,1152.360,1160.940,"Governor, with all due respect, the question was about whether it seems fair to you that Mr. Trump said he brilliantly used the laws to pay as little tax as legally possible."
f000245,1160.940,1165.300,"Well, this is probably the difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine."
f000246,1165.300,1176.120,"And, I mean, Hillary Clinton and Senator Kaine — God bless you for it, career public servants, that’s great — Donald Trump is a businessman, not a career politician."
f000247,1176.120,1177.800,He actually built a business.

f000248,1178.480,1185.520,Those tax returns that were — that came out publicly this week show that he faced some pretty tough times 20 years ago.

f000254,1203.980,1211.320,"His tax returns — his tax returns showed he went through a very difficult time, but he used the tax code just the way it’s supposed to be used."
f000255,1211.320,1212.220,And he did it brilliantly.
f000256,1212.220,1213.080,How do you know that?
