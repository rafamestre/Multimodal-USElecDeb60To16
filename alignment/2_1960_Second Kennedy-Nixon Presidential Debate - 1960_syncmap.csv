f000001,7.000,8.300,Good evening.
f000002,8.300,12.100,"This is Frank McGee, NBC News in Washington."
f000003,12.100,15.060,This is the second in a series of programs unmatched in history.
n000001,15.060,16.280,(SILENCE)
f000004,16.280,27.280,Never have so many people seen the major candidates for president of the United States at the same time; and never until this series have Americans seen the candidates in face-to-face exchange.
n000002,27.280,28.400,(SILENCE)
f000005,28.400,33.900,Tonight the candidates have agreed to devote the full hour to answering questions on any issue of the campaign.
n000003,33.900,34.960,(SILENCE)
f000006,34.960,44.520,"And here tonight are: the Republican candidate, Vice President Richard M. Nixon; and the Democratic candidate, Senator John F. Kennedy."
f000007,44.520,68.400,Now representatives of the candidates and of all the radio and television networks have agreed on these rules: neither candidate will make an opening statement or a closing summation; each will be questioned in turn; each will have an opportunity to comment upon the answer of the other; each reporter will ask only one question in turn.
f000008,68.400,70.680,He is free to ask any question he chooses.
n000004,70.680,71.600,(SILENCE)
f000009,71.600,80.400,Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked and only the clock will determine who will be asked the last question.
f000010,80.400,90.720,These programs represent an unprecedented opportunity for the candidates to present their philosophies and programs directly to the people and for the people to compare these and the candidates.
n000005,90.720,92.000,(SILENCE)
f000011,92.000,98.020,The four reporters on tonight's panel include a newspaperman and a wire service representative.
f000012,98.020,106.180,These two were selected by lot by the press secretaries of the candidates from among the reporters traveling with the candidates.
f000013,106.180,109.120,The broadcasting representatives were selected by their respective companies.
f000014,109.120,123.720,"The reporters are: Paul Niven of CBS, Edward P. Morgan of ABC, Alvin Spivak of United Press International, and Harold R. Levy of Newsday."
n000006,123.720,124.040,(SILENCE)
f000015,124.040,129.600,Now the first question is from Mr. Niven and is for Vice President Nixon.
n000007,129.600,130.800,(SILENCE)
f000016,130.800,137.140,"Mr. Vice President, Senator Kennedy said last night that the Administration must take responsibility for the loss of Cuba."
n000008,137.140,138.040,(SILENCE)
f000017,138.040,148.840,Would you compare the validity of that statement with the validity of your own statements in previous campaigns that the Truman Administration was responsible for the loss of China to the Communists?
f000018,148.840,159.760,"Well first of all, I don't agree with Senator Kennedy that Cuba is lost and certainly China was lost when this Administration came into power in 1953."
f000019,159.760,184.440,"As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States."
n000009,184.440,185.720,(SILENCE)
f000020,185.720,192.900,Now Senator Kennedy has made some very strong criticisms of my part - or alleged part - in what has happened in Cuba.
n000010,192.900,193.720,(SILENCE)
f000021,193.720,198.160,He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there.

f000022,199.000,208.960,"I can only point out that if we are going to judge the Administrations in terms of our attitude toward dictators, we're glad to have a comparison with the previous administration."
n000012,208.960,209.880,(SILENCE)
f000023,209.880,217.520,"There were eleven dictators in South America and in Central America when we came in, in 1953."
f000024,217.520,220.100,Today there are only three left including the one in Cuba.
n000013,220.100,221.160,(SILENCE)
f000025,221.160,223.700,We think that's pretty good progress.
f000026,223.700,231.520,Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.
n000014,231.520,232.800,(SILENCE)
f000027,232.800,239.680,"Now I'm very surprised that Senator Kennedy, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, would have made such a statement as this kind."
f000028,239.680,244.040,"As a matter of fact in his book, The Strategy for Peace, he took the right position."
f000029,244.040,257.080,And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.
n000015,257.080,258.080,(SILENCE)
f000030,258.080,263.120,For me to have made such a statement would been in direct uh - opposition to that treaty.
n000016,263.120,264.040,(SILENCE)
f000031,264.040,266.620,"Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear."
f000032,266.620,272.160,There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.
f000033,272.160,274.480,There isn't any question but that we will defend Guantanamo if it's attacked.
n000017,274.480,274.960,(SILENCE)
f000034,274.960,286.040,There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.
n000018,286.040,287.040,(SILENCE)
f000035,287.040,292.700,"No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit."
f000036,292.700,296.520,"Senator Kennedy, would you care to comment?"
f000037,296.520,299.600,In the first place I've never suggested that Cuba was lost except for the present.
n000019,299.600,300.360,(SILENCE)
f000038,300.360,304.320,In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.
n000020,304.320,305.160,(SILENCE)
f000039,305.160,322.560,"Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years."
f000040,322.560,326.600,"Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections."
n000021,326.600,327.320,(SILENCE)
f000041,327.320,338.000,"What I criticized was the failure of the Administration to use its great influence to persuade the Cuban government to hold free elections, particularly in 1957 and 1958."
n000022,338.000,338.720,(SILENCE)
f000042,338.720,356.600,"Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results."
n000023,356.600,357.360,(SILENCE)
f000043,357.360,367.000,"Instead our aid continued to Batista, which was ineffective; we never were on the side of freedom; we never used our influence when we could have used it most effectively - and today Cuba is lost for freedom."
n000024,367.000,367.520,(SILENCE)
f000044,367.520,388.740,"I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution."
n000025,388.740,389.680,(SILENCE)
f000045,389.680,391.960,"Mr. Morgan, with a question for Senator Kennedy."
n000026,391.960,392.920,(SILENCE)
f000046,392.920,401.460,"Senator, last May, in Oregon, you discussed the possibilities of sending apologies or regrets to Khrushchev over the U-2 incident."
n000027,401.460,402.880,(SILENCE)
f000047,402.880,405.080,Do you think now that that would have done any good?
n000028,405.080,405.480,(SILENCE)
f000048,405.480,405.760,Did you think so then?
f000049,405.760,413.660,"Mr. Morgan, I suggested that if the United States felt that it could save the summit conference that it would have been proper for us to have expressed regrets."
f000050,413.660,422.680,In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.
f000051,422.680,428.320,"Mr. Lodge, on ""Meet the Press"" a month ago, said if there was ever a case when we did not have law an our side it was in the U-2 incident."
f000052,428.320,432.440,The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.
n000029,432.440,433.080,(SILENCE)
f000053,433.080,435.880,But they were not in accordance with international law.
f000054,435.880,457.960,"And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is."
n000030,457.960,458.520,(SILENCE)
f000055,458.520,470.040,The point that is always left out is the fact that we expressed regrets to Castro this winter; that we expressed regrets - the Eisenhower Administration expressed regrets - for a flight over Southern Russia in 1958.
n000031,470.040,470.840,(SILENCE)
f000056,470.840,474.160,We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.
n000032,474.160,475.000,(SILENCE)
f000057,475.000,478.880,The Soviet Union in 1955 expressed regrets to us over the Bering Sea incident.
f000058,478.880,485.100,The Chinese Communists expressed regrets to us over a plane incident in 1956.
f000059,485.100,496.400,That is the accepted procedure between nations; and my judgment is that we should follow the advice of Theodore Roosevelt: Be strong; maintain a strong position; but also speak softly.
f000060,496.400,505.380,"I believe that in those cases where international custom calls for the expression of a regret, if that would have kept the summit going, in my judgment it was a proper action."
n000033,505.380,505.840,(SILENCE)
f000061,505.840,506.480,It's not appeasement.
n000034,506.480,506.920,(SILENCE)
f000062,506.920,507.560,It's not soft.
n000035,507.560,508.200,(SILENCE)
f000063,508.200,510.920,I believe we should be stronger than we now are.
f000064,510.920,512.640,I believe we should have a stronger military force.
n000036,512.640,513.400,(SILENCE)
f000065,513.400,515.680,I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.
n000037,515.680,516.400,(SILENCE)
f000066,516.400,535.960,"But I don't confuse words with strength; and in my judgment if the summit was useful, if it would have brought us closer to peace, that rather than the lie that we told - which has been criticized by all responsible people afterwards - it would have been far better for us to follow the common diplomatic procedure of expressing regrets and then try to move on."
f000067,535.960,537.360,Mr. Vice President.
f000068,537.360,539.920,I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.
n000038,539.920,540.360,(SILENCE)
f000069,540.360,549.620,"First of all, he's wrong in thinking th- er- even suggesting that Mr. Khrushchev might have continued the conference if we had expressed regrets."
f000070,549.620,555.020,He knew these flights were going on long before and that wasn't the reason that he broke up the conference.
f000071,555.020,557.060,"Second, he's wrong in the analogies that he makes."
n000039,557.060,557.920,(SILENCE)
f000072,557.920,560.700,The United States is a strong country.
f000073,560.700,563.100,"Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets."
f000074,563.100,577.920,"But when the president of the United States is doing something that's right, something that is for the purpose of defending the security of this country against surprise attack, he can never express regrets or apologize to anybody, including Mr. Khrushchev."
n000040,577.920,578.960,(SILENCE)
f000075,578.960,593.020,"Now in that connection Senator Kennedy has criticized the President on the ground not only of not expressing regrets, but because he allowed this flight to take place while the summit conference - or immediately before the summit conference occurred."
f000076,593.020,596.080,This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.
n000041,596.080,597.120,(SILENCE)
f000077,597.120,598.280,We all remember Pearl Harbor.
n000042,598.280,599.120,(SILENCE)
f000078,599.120,600.720,We lost three thousand American lives.
n000043,600.720,601.680,(SILENCE)
f000079,601.680,604.280,We cannot afford an intelligence gap.
f000080,604.280,610.760,And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information.
f000081,610.760,621.160,"I don't intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we're negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort."
f000082,621.160,633.860,And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.
f000083,633.860,636.720,Mr. Spivak with a question for Vice President Nixon.
f000084,636.720,644.840,"Mr. Vice President, you have accused Senator Kennedy of avoiding the civil rights issue when he has been in the South and he has accused you of the same thing."
n000044,644.840,645.640,(SILENCE)
f000085,645.640,654.740,"With both North and South listening and watching, would you sum up uh - your own intentions in the field of civil rights if you become president."
f000086,654.740,659.160,My intentions in the field of civil rights have been spelled out in the Republican platform.
f000087,659.160,661.680,I think we have to make progress first in the field of employment.
n000045,661.680,662.480,(SILENCE)
f000088,662.480,676.820,"And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts."
n000046,676.820,677.480,(SILENCE)
f000089,677.480,689.640,"Certainly I think all of us agree that when anybody has a government contract, certainly the money that is spent under that contract ought to be disbursed equally without regard to the race or creed or color of the individual who is to be employed."
n000047,689.640,690.520,(SILENCE)
f000090,690.520,700.320,"Second, in the field of schools, we believe that there should be provisions whereby the federal government would give assistance to those districts who do want to integrate their schools."
n000048,700.320,701.080,(SILENCE)
f000091,701.080,707.720,That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.
n000049,707.720,708.720,(SILENCE)
f000092,708.720,714.000,"And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership."
n000050,714.000,715.000,(SILENCE)
f000093,715.000,720.200,"And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes."
n000051,720.200,721.240,(SILENCE)
f000094,721.240,733.560,Here we have a situation which causes all of us concern - causes us concern because of the denial of the rights of people to the equality which we think belongs to everybody.
f000095,733.560,735.840,I have talked to Negro mothers.
f000096,735.840,748.000,I've heard them explain - try to explain - how they tell their children how they can go into a store and buy a loaf of bread but then can't go into that store and sit at the counter and get a Coca Cola.
f000097,748.000,750.600,"This is wrong, and we have to do something about it."
n000052,750.600,751.360,(SILENCE)
f000098,751.360,753.020,"So, under the circumstances, what do we do?"
f000099,753.020,762.620,Well what we do is what the Attorney-General of the United States did under the direction of the President: call in the owners of chain stores and get them to take action.
n000053,762.620,763.760,(SILENCE)
f000100,763.760,772.900,"Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?"
f000101,772.900,780.860,Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.
f000102,780.860,787.000,"I do it because it's the responsibility of leadership, I do it because we have to solve this problem together."
n000054,787.000,788.040,(SILENCE)
f000103,788.040,806.280,"I do it right at this time particularly because when we have Khrushchev in this country - a man who has enslaved millions, a man who has slaughtered thousands - we cannot continue to have a situation where he can point the finger at the United States of America and say that we are denying rights to our citizens."
f000104,806.280,816.260,"And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity."

f000364,2484.640,2495.460,"Senator, in your acceptance speech at Los Angeles, you said that your campaign would be based not on what you intend to offer the American people, but what you intend to ask of them."
f000365,2495.460,2503.120,Since that time you have spelled out many of the things that you intend to do but you have made only vague reference to sacrifice and self-denial.
f000366,2503.120,2509.700,"A year or so ago, I believe, you said that you would not hesitate to recommend a tax increase if you considered it necessary."
f000367,2509.700,2510.900,That's right.
f000368,2510.900,2511.840,Is this what you have in mind?
n000181,2511.840,2512.520,(SILENCE)
f000369,2512.520,2519.980,"Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable."
f000370,2519.980,2525.740,"In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy."
f000371,2525.740,2537.220,"If it ever becomes necessary, and is wise economically and essential to our security, I would have no hesitancy in suggesting a tax increase or any other policy which would defend the United States."
n000182,2537.220,2537.880,(SILENCE)
f000372,2537.880,2545.560,I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.
n000183,2545.560,2546.120,(SILENCE)
f000373,2546.120,2547.520,I'm talking about a national mood.
n000184,2547.520,2548.360,(SILENCE)
f000374,2548.360,2554.920,I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.
n000185,2554.920,2555.400,(SILENCE)
f000375,2555.400,2557.000,We don't know what the future's going to bring.
n000186,2557.000,2557.720,(SILENCE)
f000376,2557.720,2564.680,But I would not want anyone to elect me uh - president of the United States - or vote for me - under the expectation that life would be easier if I were elected.
f000377,2564.680,2573.800,"Now, many of the programs that I'm talking about - economic growth, care for the aged, development of our natural resources - build the strength of the United States."
n000187,2573.800,2574.640,(SILENCE)
f000378,2574.640,2581.600,That's how the United States began to prepare for its great actions in World War II and in the post-war period.
n000188,2581.600,2582.040,(SILENCE)
f000379,2582.040,2594.920,"If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world."
n000189,2594.920,2595.800,(SILENCE)
f000380,2595.800,2604.240,"So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home."
n000190,2604.240,2604.960,(SILENCE)
f000381,2604.960,2610.800,So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.
f000382,2610.800,2613.840,We're using our steel capacity fifty-five per cent today.
f000383,2613.840,2617.860,We're not able to consume what we're able to produce at a time when the Soviet Union is making great economic gains.
f000384,2617.860,2632.160,"And all I say is, I don't know what the sixties will bring - except I think they will bring hard times in the uh - international sphere; I hope we can move ahead here at home in the United States; I'm confident we can do a far better job of mobilizing our economy and resources in the United States."
n000191,2632.160,2632.520,(SILENCE)
f000385,2632.520,2644.960,"And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life."
f000386,2644.960,2649.200,I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.
f000387,2649.200,2653.280,Mr. Vice President.
f000388,2653.280,2659.200,Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.
n000192,2659.200,2660.480,(SILENCE)
f000389,2660.480,2669.840,"Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less."

f000390,2670.640,2672.720,In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.
n000194,2672.720,2673.560,(SILENCE)
f000391,2673.560,2677.000,I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.
n000195,2677.000,2677.680,(SILENCE)
f000392,2677.680,2678.240,I hope not.
n000196,2678.240,2678.840,(SILENCE)
f000393,2678.840,2681.520,I hope we can economize elsewhere so that we don't have to.
n000197,2681.520,2682.400,(SILENCE)
f000394,2682.400,2696.120,But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar.
f000395,2696.120,2707.680,"Because when you do not tax, and tax enough to pay for your outgo, you pay it many times over in higher prices and inflation; and I simply will not do that."
f000396,2707.680,2722.240,"I think I should also add that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, if he intends to carry out his platform - the one adopted in Los Angeles - it is just impossible for him to make good on those promises without raising taxes or without having a rise in t- prices or both."
f000397,2722.240,2722.241,"The platform suggests that it can be done through economic growth; that it can be done, in effect, with mirrors."
f000398,2722.241,2722.242,But it isn't going to be working that way.
f000399,2722.242,2727.040,You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.
f000400,2727.040,2730.840,"After all, it isn't paid for by my money, it isn't paid for by his, but by the people's money."
f000401,2730.840,2730.841,Mr. Niven with a question for Vice President Nixon.
f000402,2730.841,2740.880,"Mr. Vice President, you said that while Mr. Khrushchev is here, Senator Kennedy should talk about what's right with this country as well as what's wrong with the country."
f000403,2740.880,2768.820,"In the 1952 campaign when you were Republican candidate for Vice President, and we were eh - at war with the Communists, did you feel a similar responsibility to t- talk about what was right with the country?"
f000404,2768.820,2769.040,I did.
n000198,2769.040,2769.680,(SILENCE)
f000405,2769.680,2780.840,"And as I pointed out in 1952, I made it very clear that as far as the Korean War was concerned, that I felt that the decision to go into the war in Korea was right and necessary."
n000199,2780.840,2781.840,(SILENCE)
f000406,2781.840,2786.760,What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea.
n000200,2786.760,2787.360,(SILENCE)
f000407,2787.360,2791.220,"Now incidentally, I should point out here that Senator Kennedy has attacked our foreign policy."
f000408,2791.220,2794.400,He's said that it's been a policy that has led to defeat and retreat.
f000409,2794.400,2800.160,And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?
f000410,2800.160,2807.500,"In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China."
f000411,2807.500,2815.220,In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.
f000412,2815.220,2827.840,"I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong."
f000413,2827.840,2831.520,"But he has a responsibility to be accurate, and not to misstate the case."
n000201,2831.520,2832.560,(SILENCE)
f000414,2832.560,2835.680,I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low.
n000202,2835.680,2836.200,(SILENCE)
f000415,2836.200,2840.000,I think this is very harmful at a time Mr. Khrushchev is here - harmful because it's wrong.
f000416,2840.000,2850.880,I don't think it was helpful when he suggested - and I'm glad he's corrected this to an extent - that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night in the United States.
f000417,2850.880,2853.980,Now this just wasn't true.
f000418,2853.980,2870.040,"Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration."
f000419,2870.040,2880.840,"But the thing that is right about the United States, it should be emphasized, is that less people go to bed hungry in the United States than in any major country in the world."
f000420,2880.840,2891.560,"We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history."
n000203,2891.560,2892.000,(SILENCE)
f000421,2892.000,2901.540,"Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths."
f000422,2901.540,2903.940,It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.
f000423,2903.940,2909.380,Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.
f000424,2909.380,2911.460,"And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way."
n000204,2911.460,2912.720,(SILENCE)
f000425,2912.720,2914.240,"But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate."
f000426,2914.240,2916.640,And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.
f000427,2916.640,2916.760,Senator Kennedy.
f000428,2916.760,2931.520,"Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet."
f000429,2931.520,2941.360,"Mr. Benson, testifying on the food stamp plan in 1957, said there were twenty-five million Americans who could not afford a elementary low-cost diet."

f000431,2945.680,2950.360,Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.
n000207,2950.360,2951.160,(SILENCE)
f000432,2951.160,2959.280,You can't tell me that a surplus food distribution of five cents po- per person - and that n- nearly six million Americans receiving that - is adequate.
f000433,2959.280,2967.480,You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.
f000434,2967.480,2977.200,I believe that we should not compare what our figures may be to India or some other country that has serious problems but to remember that we are the most prosperous country in the world and that these people are not getting adequate food.
f000435,2977.200,2980.000,And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.
n000208,2980.000,2980.320,(SILENCE)
f000436,2980.320,2982.680,And we ought to try to meet the problem.
f000437,2982.680,2989.980,"Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost."
f000438,2989.980,2991.800,They're wholly inaccurate.
f000439,2991.800,2993.360,I said last week I believed in a balanced budget.

f000440,2994.000,3002.160,"Unless there was a severe recession - and after all the worst unbalanced budget in history was in 1958, twelve billion dollars - larger than in any Administration in the history of the United States."
n000210,3002.160,3002.680,(SILENCE)
f000441,3002.680,3011.420,So that I believe that on this subject we can balance the budget unless we have a national emergency or unless we have a severe recession.

f000442,3012.480,3016.240,Mr. Morgan with a question for Senator Kennedy.
f000443,3016.240,3027.060,"Senator, Saturday on television you said that you had always thought that Quemoy and Matsu were unwise places to draw our defense line in the Far East."
f000444,3027.060,3037.060,Would you comment further on that and also address to this question; couldn't a pullback from those islands be interpreted as appeasement?
f000445,3037.060,3045.000,"Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa."
f000446,3045.000,3046.640,I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.
n000212,3046.640,3047.240,(SILENCE)
f000447,3047.240,3054.840,"These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa."
f000448,3054.840,3060.400,We have never said flatly that we will defend Quemoy and Matsu if it's attacked.
f000449,3060.400,3063.560,We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.
n000213,3063.560,3063.960,(SILENCE)
f000450,3063.960,3065.520,But it's extremely difficult to make that judgment.
f000451,3065.520,3072.800,"Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible."
f000452,3072.800,3079.000,"Admirals Spruance and Callins in 1955 said that we should not attempt to defend these islands, in their conference in the Far East."

f000454,3081.760,3088.080,"I believe that when you get into a w- if you're going to get into war for the defense of Formosa, it ought to be on a clearly defined line."
f000455,3088.080,3095.460,"One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked."
f000456,3095.460,3097.120,I believe that we should defend Formosa.
f000457,3097.120,3099.580,We should come to its defense.
f000458,3099.580,3104.720,"To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake."

f000463,3140.140,3142.680,I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.
f000464,3142.680,3143.040,I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.
f000465,3143.040,3146.060,I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.
f000466,3146.060,3152.600,But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.
f000467,3152.600,3172.400,"And as long as they are not essential to the defense of Formosa, it's been my judgment ever since 1954, at the time of the Eisenhower Doctrine for the Far East, that our line should be drawn in the sea around the island itself."

f000480,3226.240,3227.200,The Nationalists have these two islands.
f000481,3227.200,3234.660,We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.
