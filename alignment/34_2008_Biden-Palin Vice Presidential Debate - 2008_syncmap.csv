f000001,7.000,11.240,"Good evening from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri."
f000002,11.240,15.100,"I'm Gwen Ifill of ""The NewsHour"" and ""Washington Week"" on PBS."

f000004,27.120,33.340,The Commission on Presidential Debates is the sponsor of this event and the two remaining presidential debates.

f000006,39.840,43.640,It will be divided roughly into five-minute segments.
f000007,43.640,50.960,Each candidate will have 90 seconds to respond to a direct question and then an additional two minutes for rebuttal and follow-up.
n000004,50.960,51.400,(SILENCE)
f000008,51.400,54.860,The order has been determined by a coin toss.
f000009,54.860,62.520,The specific subjects and questions were chosen by me and have not been shared or cleared with anyone on the campaigns or on the commission.

f000010,63.040,101.880,"The audience here in the hall has promised to remain very polite, no cheers, applause, no untoward outbursts, except right at this minute now, as we welcome Governor Palin and Senator Biden."
f000011,101.880,101.881,(APPLAUSE)
f000012,101.881,101.882,Nice to meet you.
f000013,101.882,101.883,It's a pleasure.
f000014,101.883,103.520,"Hey, can I call you Joe?"
f000015,103.520,104.080,Thank you.
f000016,104.080,104.240,"Thank you, Gwen."
f000017,104.240,104.480,Thank you.
f000018,104.480,104.520,Thank you.
f000019,104.520,104.780,Welcome to you both.
f000020,104.780,110.940,"As we have determined by a coin toss, the first question will go to Senator Biden, with a 90-second follow-up from Governor Palin."
f000021,110.940,116.020,"The House of Representatives this week passed a bill, a big bailout bill -- or didn't pass it, I should say."
f000022,116.020,119.960,"The Senate decided to pass it, and the House is wrestling with it still tonight."

f000023,120.440,134.680,"As America watches these things happen on Capitol Hill, Senator Biden, was this the worst of Washington or the best of Washington that we saw play out?"
n000007,134.680,135.160,(SILENCE)
f000024,135.160,136.840,"Let me begin by thanking you, Gwen, for hosting this."
f000025,136.840,142.200,"And, Governor, it's a pleasure to meet you, and it's a pleasure to be with you."
f000026,142.200,154.000,"I think it's neither the best or worst of Washington, but it's evidence of the fact that the economic policies of the last eight years have been the worst economic policies we've ever had."
f000027,154.000,155.680,"As a consequence, you've seen what's happened on Wall Street."
f000028,155.680,162.120,"If you need any more proof positive of how bad the economic theories have been, this excessive deregulation, the failure to oversee what was going on, letting Wall Street run wild, I don't think you needed any more evidence than what you see now."
f000029,162.120,166.120,So the Congress has been put -- Democrats and Republicans have been put in a very difficult spot.
n000008,166.120,166.840,(SILENCE)
f000030,166.840,175.320,But Barack Obama laid out four basic criteria for any kind of rescue plan here.
f000031,175.320,176.920,"He, first of all, said there has to be oversight."
f000032,176.920,180.540,We're not going to write any check to anybody unless there's oversight for the -- of the secretary of Treasury.
n000009,180.540,181.240,(SILENCE)
f000033,181.240,185.580,He secondly said you have to focus on homeowners and folks on Main Street.
f000034,185.580,190.940,"Thirdly, he said that you have to treat the taxpayers like investors in this case."
f000035,190.940,199.780,"And, lastly, what you have to do is make sure that CEOs don't benefit from this, because this could end up, in the long run, people making money off of this rescue plan."
f000036,199.780,214.360,"And so, as a consequence of that, it brings us back to maybe the fundamental disagreement between Governor Palin and me and Senator McCain and Barack Obama, and that is that the -- we're going to fundamentally change the focus of the economic policy."
f000037,214.360,221.760,"We're going to focus on the middle class, because it's -- when the middle class is growing, the economy grows and everybody does well, not just focus on the wealthy and corporate America."
n000010,221.760,222.480,(SILENCE)
f000038,222.480,223.320,"Thank you, Senator."
f000039,223.320,223.660,Governor Palin?
f000040,223.660,225.440,"Thank you, Gwen."
f000041,225.440,227.040,"And I thank the commission, also."
f000042,227.040,230.600,I appreciate this privilege of being able to be here and speak with Americans.
n000011,230.600,231.400,(SILENCE)
f000043,231.400,245.220,"You know, I think a good barometer here, as we try to figure out has this been a good time or a bad time in America's economy, is go to a kid's soccer game on Saturday, and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them, ""How are you feeling about the economy?"""
f000044,245.220,254.840,"And I'll bet you, you're going to hear some fear in that parent's voice, fear regarding the few investments that some of us have in the stock market."
f000045,254.840,256.620,Did we just take a major hit with those investments?
f000046,256.620,261.540,"Fear about, how are we going to afford to send our kids to college?"
n000012,261.540,262.000,(SILENCE)
f000047,262.000,268.480,"A fear, as small-business owners, perhaps, how we're going to borrow any money to increase inventory or hire more people."
n000013,268.480,268.960,(SILENCE)
f000048,268.960,280.320,"The barometer there, I think, is going to be resounding that our economy is hurting and the federal government has not provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve, and we need reform to that end."
f000049,280.320,284.620,"Now, John McCain thankfully has been one representing reform."
f000050,284.620,290.840,"Two years ago, remember, it was John McCain who pushed so hard with the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures."
f000051,290.840,292.280,He sounded that warning bell.
n000014,292.280,292.920,(SILENCE)
f000052,292.920,300.120,"People in the Senate with him, his colleagues, didn't want to listen to him and wouldn't go towards that reform that was needed then."
n000015,300.120,300.680,(SILENCE)
f000053,300.680,317.880,"I think that the alarm has been heard, though, and there will be that greater oversight, again thanks to John McCain's bipartisan efforts that he was so instrumental in bringing folks together over this past week, even suspending his own campaign to make sure he was putting excessive politics aside and putting the country first."
n000016,317.880,319.200,(SILENCE)
f000054,319.200,320.580,You both would like to be vice president.
f000055,320.580,330.240,"Senator Biden, how, as vice president, would you work to shrink this gap of polarization which has sprung up in Washington, which you both have spoken about here tonight?"
f000056,330.240,345.000,"Well, that's what I've done my whole career, Gwen, on very, very controversial issues, from dealing with violence against women, to putting 100,000 police officers on the street, to trying to get something done about the genocide in -- that was going on in Bosnia."
f000057,345.000,346.620,And I -- I have been able to reach across the aisle.
f000058,346.620,353.920,I think it's fair to say that I have almost as many friends on the Republican side of the aisle as I do the Democratic side of the aisle.
f000059,353.920,356.720,But am I able to respond to -- are we able to stay on the -- on the topic?
f000060,356.720,357.480,"You may, if you like."
n000017,357.480,357.880,(SILENCE)
f000061,357.880,367.080,"Yes, well, you know, until two weeks ago -- it was two Mondays ago John McCain said at 9 o'clock in the morning that the fundamentals of the economy were strong."
n000018,367.080,367.880,(SILENCE)
f000062,367.880,372.500,"Two weeks before that, he said George -- we've made great economic progress under George Bush's policies."

f000063,373.400,375.520,"Nine o'clock, the economy was strong."
f000064,375.520,380.700,"Eleven o'clock that same day, two Mondays ago, John McCain said that we have an economic crisis."
f000065,380.700,385.240,"That doesn't make John McCain a bad guy, but it does point out he's out of touch."
f000066,385.240,387.980,Those folks on the sidelines knew that two months ago.
f000067,387.980,389.560,"Governor Palin, you may respond."
n000020,389.560,390.480,(SILENCE)
f000068,390.480,398.380,"John McCain, in referring to the fundamental of our economy being strong, he was talking to and he was talking about the American workforce."
n000021,398.380,398.880,(SILENCE)
f000069,398.880,407.360,"And the American workforce is the greatest in this world, with the ingenuity and the work ethic that is just entrenched in our workforce."
f000070,407.360,408.560,That's a positive.
f000071,408.560,409.720,That's encouragement.
f000072,409.720,410.880,And that's what John McCain meant.
f000073,410.880,416.080,"Now, what I've done as a governor and as a mayor is (inaudible) I've had that track record of reform."
f000074,416.080,425.960,"And I've joined this team that is a team of mavericks with John McCain, also, with his track record of reform, where we're known for putting partisan politics aside to just get the job done."
n000022,425.960,426.320,(SILENCE)
f000075,426.320,430.140,"Now, Barack Obama, of course, he's pretty much only voted along his party lines."
f000076,430.140,446.080,"In fact, 96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line, not having that proof for the American people to know that his commitment, too, is, you know, put the partisanship, put the special interests aside, and get down to getting business done for the people of America."
n000023,446.080,446.440,(SILENCE)
f000077,446.440,448.400,We're tired of the old politics as usual.
f000078,448.400,456.280,"And that's why, with all due respect, I do respect your years in the U.S. Senate, but I think Americans are craving something new and different and that new energy and that new commitment that's going to come with reform."
f000079,456.280,464.840,"I think that's why we need to send the maverick from the Senate and put him in the White House, and I'm happy to join him there."
f000080,464.840,468.480,"Governor, Senator, neither of you really answered that last question about what you would do as vice president."
f000081,468.480,469.980,I'm going to come back to that... (LAUGHTER)
n000024,469.980,470.600,(SILENCE)
f000082,470.600,473.080,"... throughout the evening to try to see if we can look forward, as well."
n000025,473.080,473.600,(SILENCE)
f000083,473.600,477.400,"Now, let's talk about -- the next question is to talk about the subprime lending meltdown."
f000084,477.400,480.040,Who do you think was at fault?
n000026,480.040,480.360,(SILENCE)
f000085,480.360,481.800,"I start with you, Governor Palin."
n000027,481.800,482.280,(SILENCE)
f000086,482.280,484.980,Was it the greedy lenders?
f000087,484.980,488.260,Was it the risky home-buyers who shouldn't have been buying a home in the first place?
f000088,488.260,490.740,And what should you be doing about it?
f000089,490.740,501.220,"Darn right it was the predator lenders, who tried to talk Americans into thinking that it was smart to buy a $300,000 house if we could only afford a $100,000 house."
f000090,501.220,505.480,"There was deception there, and there was greed and there is corruption on Wall Street."
n000028,505.480,505.840,(SILENCE)
f000091,505.840,507.440,And we need to stop that.
f000092,507.440,513.840,"Again, John McCain and I, that commitment that we have made, and we're going to follow through on that, getting rid of that corruption."
f000093,513.840,527.880,"One thing that Americans do at this time, also, though, is let's commit ourselves just every day American people, Joe Six Pack, hockey moms across the nation, I think we need to band together and say never again."
n000029,527.880,528.280,(SILENCE)
f000094,528.280,536.120,Never will we be exploited and taken advantage of again by those who are managing our money and loaning us these dollars.
n000030,536.120,536.480,(SILENCE)
f000095,536.480,547.920,We need to make sure that we demand from the federal government strict oversight of those entities in charge of our investments and our savings and we need also to not get ourselves in debt.
f000096,547.920,552.840,Let's do what our parents told us before we probably even got that first credit card.

n000032,554.960,555.280,(SILENCE)
f000098,555.280,559.880,We need to make sure that as individuals we're taking personal responsibility through all of this.
f000099,559.880,571.800,"It's not the American peoplesâ€™s fault that the economy is hurting like it is, but we have an opportunity to learn a heck of a lot of good lessons through this and say never again will we be taken advantage of."
n000033,571.800,573.520,(SILENCE)
f000100,573.520,574.100,Senator?
f000101,574.100,579.560,"Well Gwen, two years ago Barack Obama warned about the sub prime mortgage crisis."
n000034,579.560,580.120,(SILENCE)
f000102,580.120,586.680,John McCain said shortly after that in December he was surprised there was a sub prime mortgage problem.
f000103,586.680,596.220,"John McCain while Barack Obama was warning about what we had to do was literally giving an interview to ""The Wall Street Journal"" saying that I'm always for cutting regulations."
n000035,596.220,596.840,(SILENCE)
f000104,596.840,599.720,We let Wall Street run wild.
f000105,599.720,609.540,"John McCain and he's a good man, but John McCain thought the answer is that tried and true Republican response, deregulate, deregulate."
f000106,609.540,613.140,"So what you had is you had overwhelming ""deregulation."""
f000107,613.140,616.820,You had actually the belief that Wall Street could self-regulate itself.
f000108,616.820,626.240,"And while Barack Obama was talking about reinstating those regulations, John on 20 different occasions in the previous year and a half called for more deregulation."
f000109,626.240,638.980,"As a matter of fact, John recently wrote an article in a major magazine saying that he wants to do for the health care industry deregulate it and let the free market move like he did for the banking industry."
f000110,638.980,640.640,So deregulation was the promise.
f000111,640.640,641.500,And guess what?

f000118,657.020,660.260,"The middle class needs relief, tax relief."
f000119,660.260,661.180,They need it now.
f000120,661.180,662.260,They need help now.

f000124,670.800,678.340,We can speak in agreement here that darn right we need tax relief for Americans so that jobs can be created here.
f000125,678.340,685.160,"Now, Barack Obama and Senator Biden also voted for the largest tax increases in U.S. history."

f000138,747.260,748.780,John McCain voted the same way.
f000139,748.780,749.820,It did not raise taxes.
f000140,749.820,757.940,"Number two, using the standard that the governor uses, John McCain voted 477 times to raise taxes."
f000141,757.940,773.180,"It's a bogus standard it but if you notice, Gwen, the governor did not answer the question about deregulation, did not answer the question of defending John McCain about not going along with the deregulation, letting Wall Street run wild."

f000145,781.500,784.520,I'm still on the tax thing because I want to correct you on that again.
f000146,784.520,786.880,And I want to let you know what I did as a mayor and as a governor.

f000809,4411.880,4413.560,John McCain would acknowledge that.

f000817,4447.120,4449.340,"That is sort of my reputation, as you know."
f000818,4449.340,4460.760,"So I look forward to working with Barack and playing a very constructive role in his presidency, bringing about the kind of change this country needs."
f000819,4460.760,4465.960,"Governor, you mentioned a moment ago that the Constitution might give the vice president more power than it has in the past."
f000820,4465.960,4476.280,"Do you believe as Vice President Cheney does, that the Executive Branch does not hold complete sway over the office of the vice presidency, that it it is also a member of the Legislative Branch?"
f000821,4476.280,4483.700,"Well, our founding fathers were very wise there in allowing through the Constitution much flexibility there in the Office of the Vice President."
f000822,4483.700,4494.920,And we will do what is best for the American people in tapping into that position and ushering in an agenda that is supportive and cooperative with the president's agenda in that position.

f000885,4806.760,4811.440,And John McCain has been the consummate maverick in the Senate over all these years.
f000886,4811.440,4824.680,"He's taken shots left and right from the other party and from within his own party, because he's had to take on his own party when the time was right, when he recognized it was time to put partisanship aside and just do what was right for the American people."

f000898,4894.280,4894.520,Senator...
f000899,4894.520,4895.140,I'll be very brief.

f000902,4899.680,4903.840,"He's been a maverick on some issues, but he has been no maverick on the things that matter to people's lives."
f000903,4903.840,4912.120,"He voted four out of five times for George Bush's budget, which put us a half a trillion dollars in debt this year and over $3 trillion in debt since he's got there."
f000904,4912.120,4915.140,He has not been a maverick in providing health care for people.

f000913,4948.420,4950.940,How are we going to heat the -- heat the house this winter?
f000914,4950.940,4957.960,"He voted against even providing for what they call LIHEAP, for assistance to people, with oil prices going through the roof in the winter."
f000915,4957.960,4962.420,"So maverick he is not on the important, critical issues that affect people at that kitchen table."

f000918,4984.160,4985.220,"Yes, I can."
f000919,4985.220,5006.020,"When I got to the United States Senate and went on the Judiciary Committee as a young lawyer, I was of the view and had been trained in the view that the only thing that mattered was whether or not a nominee appointed, suggested by the president had a judicial temperament, had not committed a crime of moral turpitude, and was -- had been a good student."
f000920,5006.020,5015.340,"And it didn't take me long -- it was hard to change, but it didn't take me long, but it took about five years for me to realize that the ideology of that judge makes a big difference."
f000921,5015.340,5017.680,That's why I led the fight against Judge Bork.
f000922,5017.680,5029.080,"Had he been on the court, I suspect there would be a lot of changes that I don't like and the American people wouldn't like, including everything from Roe v. Wade to issues relating to civil rights and civil liberties."

f000924,5036.500,5044.700,And that's why I was the first chairman of the Judiciary Committee to forthrightly state that it matters what your judicial philosophy is.
f000925,5044.700,5047.680,The American people have a right to understand it and to know it.
f000926,5047.680,5050.680,"But I did change on that, and -- and I'm glad I did."

f000929,5071.800,5079.740,"So there were times when I wanted to zero-base budget, and to cut taxes even more, and I didn't have enough support in order to accomplish that."
f000930,5079.740,5088.420,"But on the major principle things, no, there hasn't been something that I've had to compromise on, because we've always seemed to find a way to work together."
