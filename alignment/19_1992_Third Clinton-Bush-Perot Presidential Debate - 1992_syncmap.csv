HEAD,0.000,8.000,
f000001,8.000,9.000,Good evening.
f000002,9.000,15.320,Welcome to this third and final debate among the three major candidates for president of the US.
n000001,15.320,16.120,(SILENCE)
f000003,16.120,51.600,"Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic nominee, President George Bush, the Republican nominee, -- (APPLAUSE)  -- and independent candidate Ross Perot."
f000004,51.600,53.600,(APPLAUSE)  I am Jim Lehrer of the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour on PBS.
f000005,53.600,59.200,"I will be the moderator for this debate, which is being sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates."
f000006,59.200,61.240,It will be 90 minutes long.
f000007,61.240,67.640,It is happening before an audience on the campus of Michigan State University in East Lansing.
f000008,67.640,77.840,"The format was conceived by and agreed to by representatives of the Bush and Clinton campaigns, and it is somewhat different than those used in the earlier debates."
n000002,77.840,78.200,(SILENCE)
f000009,78.200,83.740,I will ask questions for the first half under rules that permit follow-ups.
f000010,83.740,88.800,A panel of 3 other journalists will ask questions in the 2nd half under rules that do not.
n000003,88.800,89.360,(SILENCE)
f000011,89.360,94.380,"As always, each candidate will have 2 minutes, up to 2 minutes, to make a closing statement."
f000012,94.380,100.400,"The order of those, as well as that for the formal questioning, were all determined by a drawing."
n000004,100.400,101.480,(SILENCE)
f000013,101.480,104.780,"Gentlemen, again welcome and again good evening."
n000005,104.780,105.840,(SILENCE)
f000014,105.840,127.480,"It seems, from what some of those voters said at your Richmond debate, and from polling and other data, that each of you, fairly or not, faces serious voter concerns about the underlying credibility and believability of what each of you says you would do as president in the next 4 years."
n000006,127.480,127.800,(SILENCE)
f000015,127.800,149.840,"Governor Clinton, in accordance with the draw, those concerns about you are first: you are promising to create jobs, reduce the deficit, reform the health care system, rebuild the infrastructure, guarantee college education for everyone who is qualified, among many other things, all with financial pain only for the very rich."
n000007,149.840,150.360,(SILENCE)
f000016,150.360,154.160,Some people are having trouble apparently believing that is possible.
n000008,154.160,155.000,(SILENCE)
f000017,155.000,156.080,Should they have that concern?
n000009,156.080,156.720,(SILENCE)
f000018,156.720,156.960,No.
n000010,156.960,158.880,(SILENCE)
f000019,158.880,176.520,"There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down."
n000011,176.520,177.200,(SILENCE)
f000020,177.200,182.280,"The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up."
n000012,182.280,183.040,(SILENCE)
f000021,183.040,190.800,"Middle-class people will have their fair share of changing to do, and many challenges to face, including the challenge of becoming constantly re-educated."
n000013,190.800,191.520,(SILENCE)
f000022,191.520,198.680,"But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way."
f000023,198.680,205.120,"It's also a departure from tax-and- spend economics, because you can't tax and divide an economy that isn't growing."
n000014,205.120,205.600,(SILENCE)
f000024,205.600,211.520,I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.
n000015,211.520,212.040,(SILENCE)
f000025,212.040,236.200,"I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts."
n000016,236.200,236.560,(SILENCE)
f000026,236.560,238.680,Invest and grow.
f000027,238.680,250.100,"Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems."
f000028,250.100,251.440,This will work.
f000029,251.440,256.480,"On this, as on so many other issues, I have a fundamental difference from the present administration."
n000017,256.480,257.000,(SILENCE)
f000030,257.000,259.560,I don't believe trickle down economics will work.
f000031,259.560,260.800,Unemployment is up.
f000032,260.800,264.380,Most people are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago.
f000033,264.380,268.120,I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.
f000034,268.120,271.440,"Mr. President, a response."
f000035,271.440,272.840,Do I have 1 minute?
f000036,272.840,274.800,Just the ground rules here.
f000037,274.800,275.320,Roughly 1 minute.
f000038,275.320,277.320,We can loosen that up a little bit but go ahead.
f000039,277.320,285.960,"Well, he doesn't like trickle down government but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs."
n000018,285.960,286.400,(SILENCE)
f000040,286.400,290.520,The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.
f000041,290.520,292.960,And what I don't like is trickle down government.
n000019,292.960,293.520,(SILENCE)
f000042,293.520,301.280,"And therein, I think Governor Clinton keeps talking about trickle down, trickle down, and he's still talking about spending more and taxing more."
n000020,301.280,302.320,(SILENCE)
f000043,302.320,305.840,"Government -- he says invest government, grow government."
f000044,305.840,307.540,Government doesn't create jobs.
f000045,307.540,309.240,"If they do, they're make-work jobs."
n000021,309.240,309.920,(SILENCE)
f000046,309.920,312.080,It's the private sector that creates jobs.
n000022,312.080,312.440,(SILENCE)
f000047,312.440,317.020,"And yes, we've got too many taxes on the American people and we're spending too much."
f000048,317.020,322.640,And that's why I want to get the deficit down by controlling the growth of mandatory spending.
n000023,322.640,323.080,(SILENCE)
f000049,323.080,324.360,It won't be painless.
f000050,324.360,326.720,I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.
f000051,326.720,330.440,It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done.
n000024,330.440,330.920,(SILENCE)
f000052,330.920,333.160,But not by raising taxes.
f000053,333.160,347.880,"Mr. and Mrs. America, when you hear him say we're going to tax only the rich, watch your wallet because his figures don't add up and he's going to sock it right to the middle class taxpayer and lower, if he's going to pay for all the spending programs he proposes."
f000054,347.880,350.880,So we have a big difference on this trickle down theory.
f000055,350.880,353.500,I do not want any more trickle down government.
f000056,353.500,354.480,It's gotten too big.
f000057,354.480,355.400,I want to do something about that.
n000025,355.400,355.840,(SILENCE)
f000058,355.840,360.880,"Mr. Perot, what do you think of the governor's approach, what he just laid out?"
n000026,360.880,361.600,(SILENCE)
f000059,361.600,364.400,"The basic problem with it, it doesn't balance the budget."
f000060,364.400,370.040,"If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them."
f000061,370.040,372.240,Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding.
f000062,372.240,376.200,"If you take a patient into the hospital that's bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding."
n000027,376.200,376.840,(SILENCE)
f000063,376.840,378.440,And we are bleeding arterially.
f000064,378.440,395.800,"There's only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base -- see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact."
f000065,395.800,396.640,We have spent their money.
f000066,396.640,397.720,We've got to pay it back.
n000028,397.720,398.080,(SILENCE)
f000067,398.080,400.440,"This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice."
f000068,400.440,403.280,My plan balances the budget within 6 years.
n000029,403.280,404.440,(SILENCE)
f000069,404.440,407.400,We didn't do it faster than that because we didn't want to disrupt the economy.
n000030,407.400,408.080,(SILENCE)
f000070,408.080,412.600,We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover.
f000071,412.600,416.840,"But we faced it and we did it, and we believe it's fair, shared sacrifice."
n000031,416.840,417.240,(SILENCE)
f000072,417.240,422.200,The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.
n000032,422.200,422.520,(SILENCE)
f000073,422.520,428.080,"You've had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you'll understand it."
f000074,428.080,430.760,"I think that's fundamental in our country, that you know what you're getting into."
n000033,430.760,431.800,(SILENCE)
f000075,431.800,448.440,"Governor, the word ""pain"" -- one of the other leadership things that's put on you is that you don't speak of pain, that you speak of all things -- nobody's going to really have to suffer under your plan."
f000076,448.440,450.600,You've heard what Mr. Perot has said.
f000077,450.600,455.800,"He's said it's got -- to do the things that you want to do, you can't do it by just taking the money from the rich."
f000078,455.800,457.600,That's what the president says as well.
f000079,457.600,458.400,How do you respond to that?
f000080,458.400,459.920,They said the numbers don't add up.
f000081,459.920,460.680,I disagree with both of them.
n000034,460.680,461.240,(SILENCE)
f000082,461.240,463.360,"For one thing, let me just follow up here."
n000035,463.360,464.000,(SILENCE)
f000083,464.000,472.800,I disagree with Mr. Perot that the answer is to raise -- put a 50-cent gas tax on the middle class and raise more taxes on the middle class and the working poor than on the wealthy.
n000036,472.800,473.680,(SILENCE)
f000084,473.680,480.160,His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.
f000085,480.160,485.320,"And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't."
n000037,485.320,485.760,(SILENCE)
f000086,485.760,492.000,"And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief."
f000087,492.000,494.680,He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.
n000038,494.680,495.360,(SILENCE)
f000088,495.360,504.120,"And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent."
n000039,504.120,504.720,(SILENCE)
f000089,504.720,508.000,"Now, it's hard to out-spend Congress but he tried to for the last 3 years."
n000040,508.000,508.560,(SILENCE)
f000090,508.560,512.520,"So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim."
n000041,512.520,513.280,(SILENCE)
f000091,513.280,516.360,"Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?"
f000092,516.360,516.760,Yes.
f000093,516.760,521.760,"Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they're upper income people?"
f000094,521.760,522.600,Yes.
f000095,522.600,524.440,But look what's happened to the middle class.
f000096,524.440,530.280,Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they're paying higher taxes.
n000042,530.280,531.120,(SILENCE)
f000097,531.120,533.200,The tax burden on them has not gone down.
f000098,533.200,534.040,It has gone up.
f000099,534.040,541.200,"I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector."
f000100,541.200,543.440,The answer is to invest and grow this economy.
f000101,543.440,545.680,That's what works in other countries and that's what'll work here.
f000102,545.680,556.360,"As a practical matter, Mr. President, do you agree with the governor when he says that the middle class, the taxes on the middle class -- do your numbers agree that the taxes on the middle class have gone up during the last --"
f000103,556.360,558.400,I think everybody's paying too much taxes.
f000104,558.400,560.280,He refers to one tax increase.
n000043,560.280,560.680,(SILENCE)
f000105,560.680,567.120,"Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it."
f000106,567.120,568.480,And I said I make a mistake.
f000107,568.480,569.760,"If I make a mistake, I admit it."
f000108,569.760,571.440,That's quite different than some.
f000109,571.440,573.320,But I think that's the American way.
f000110,573.320,579.560,"I think everyone's paying too much, but I think this idea that you can go out and -- then he hits me for vetoing a tax bill."
f000111,579.560,580.660,"Yes, I did."
f000112,580.660,586.560,And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a president to stand up to a spending Congress.
f000113,586.560,594.000,"We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates -- who remembers that?"
f000114,594.000,599.520,"They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15."
f000115,599.520,601.360,We don't want to go back to that.
f000116,601.360,610.440,"And so yes, everybody's taxed too much and I want to get the taxes down, but not by signing a tax bill that's gonna raise taxes on people."
f000117,610.440,621.240,"Mr. President, when you said just then that you admit your mistakes and you looked at Governor Clinton and said -- what mistake is it that you want him to admit to?"
f000118,621.240,622.680,"Well, the record in Arkansas."
n000044,622.680,623.400,(SILENCE)
f000119,623.400,627.180,"I mean, look at it, and that's what we're asking America to have?"
f000120,627.180,629.280,"Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state."
f000121,629.280,629.960,They are.
f000122,629.960,633.080,But in almost every category they're lagging.
f000123,633.080,634.000,I'll give you an example.
n000045,634.000,634.360,(SILENCE)
f000124,634.360,637.800,He talks about all the jobs he's created in one or 2 years.
f000125,637.800,646.000,"Over the last ten years since he's been governor, they're 30% behind, 30% -- they're 30% of the national average."
f000126,646.000,651.880,"On pay for teachers, on all these categories, Arkansas is right near the very bottom."
f000127,651.880,658.520,"You haven't heard me mention this before, but we're getting close now and I think it's about time I start putting things in perspective."
f000128,658.520,660.040,And I'm going to do that.
f000129,660.040,666.640,"It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here."
f000130,666.640,667.800,So we've got to do that.
f000131,667.800,668.920,I gotta get it in perspective.
n000046,668.920,669.440,(SILENCE)
f000132,669.440,670.480,What's his mistake?
f000133,670.480,678.140,"Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is."
f000134,678.140,678.880,"Governor, is that true?"
n000047,678.880,680.480,(SILENCE)
f000135,680.480,686.200,"Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year, first."
f000136,686.200,686.600,This year.
f000137,686.600,691.400,"4th in manufacturing jobs, 4th in the reduction of poverty, 4th in income increase."
n000048,691.400,692.160,(SILENCE)
f000138,692.160,696.760,Over the last 10 years we've created manufacturing jobs much more rapidly than the national average.
n000049,696.760,697.120,(SILENCE)
f000139,697.120,701.200,Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.
f000140,701.200,705.440,"We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country."
f000141,705.440,709.400,We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country.
f000142,709.400,711.880,"We're low spending, low tax burden."
f000143,711.880,715.080,We dramatically increased investment and our jobs are growing.
f000144,715.080,722.080,I wish America had that kind of record and I think most people looking at us tonight would like it if we had more jobs and a lower spending burden on the government.
n000050,722.080,722.440,(SILENCE)
f000145,722.440,728.800,"Mr. Perot, if you were sitting at home now and just heard this exchange about Arkansas, who would you believe?"
f000146,728.800,731.560,I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.
f000147,731.560,736.560,Let's put it in perspective.
f000148,736.560,738.800,It's a beautiful state.
f000149,738.800,740.120,It's a fairly rural state.
f000150,740.120,745.880,"It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined."

f000427,2188.040,2190.120,Is there an equal time rule tonight?
f000428,2190.120,2191.000,Yes.
f000429,2191.000,2193.160,Or do you just keep lunging in at will?

f000430,2193.800,2197.960,"I thought we were going to have equal time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other 2."
f000431,2197.960,2198.920,Is that the way it works?
f000432,2198.920,2200.520,"No, it's -- Mr. Perot, you're doing fine."
f000433,2200.520,2201.240,Go ahead.
f000434,2201.240,2202.800,"Whatever you want to say, say it."
f000435,2202.800,2207.720,"Now that we've talked all around the problem about free trade, let's go again to the center of the bull's- eye."
f000436,2207.720,2207.960,Wait a minute.
f000437,2207.960,2210.120,I was going to ask -- I thought you wanted to respond to what we're talking about.
f000438,2210.120,2211.520,"I do, I do."
f000439,2211.520,2212.040,All right.
f000440,2212.040,2214.600,"I just want to make -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing."
n000148,2214.600,2216.320,(SILENCE)
f000441,2216.320,2219.560,Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.
f000442,2219.560,2220.720,We don't have free trade.
n000149,2220.720,2221.200,(SILENCE)
f000443,2221.200,2226.560,Both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves in key roles in their campaigns.
f000444,2226.560,2230.240,"And if there's anything more unwise than that, I don't know what it is."
f000445,2230.240,2232.840,"Every debate I bring this up, and nobody ever addresses it."
f000446,2232.840,2240.520,I would like for them to look you in the eye and tell you why they have people representing foreign countries working on their campaigns.
f000447,2240.520,2249.920,"And you know, you've seen the list, I've seen the list, we won't go into the names, but no wonder they -- if I had those people around me all day every day, telling me it was fair and free, I might believe it."
n000150,2249.920,2250.400,(SILENCE)
f000448,2250.400,2259.440,"But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us."

f000449,2260.360,2267.320,"Now, Japanese couldn't unload the cars in this country if they had the same restrictions we had, and on and on and on and on and on."

f000451,2276.640,2278.280,And it goes on and on.
f000452,2278.280,2281.280,And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.
n000154,2281.280,2281.920,(SILENCE)
f000453,2281.920,2283.320,They're foreign lobbyists taking leaves.
f000454,2283.320,2286.080,What do you think they're going to do when the campaign's over?
f000455,2286.080,2289.600,"Go back to work at 30,000 bucks a month representing some other country."
n000155,2289.600,2290.000,(SILENCE)
f000456,2290.000,2293.200,I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.

f000459,2297.121,2298.760,"Mr. President, how do you respond to that?"
f000460,2298.760,2301.280,Mr. Perot's made that charge several times.
f000461,2301.280,2307.600,The fact that you have people working in your campaign who are paid foreign lobbyists.
f000462,2307.600,2310.000,Most people that are lobbying are lobbying the Congress.
n000156,2310.000,2310.840,(SILENCE)
f000463,2310.840,2317.280,And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.
f000464,2317.280,2318.700,That's the American way.
f000465,2318.700,2325.120,And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.
f000466,2325.120,2327.200,I don't agree with that.
n000157,2327.200,2327.720,(SILENCE)
f000467,2327.720,2336.560,"But if I found somebody that had a conflict of interest that would try to illegally do something as a foreign -- registered lobby, the laws cover this."
f000468,2336.560,2345.660,"I don't know why -- I've never understood quite why Mr. Perot was so upset it, because one of the guys he used to have working for him, I believe, had foreign accounts."
f000469,2345.660,2347.200,"Could be wrong, but I think so."
f000470,2347.200,2350.600,"And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door."
f000471,2350.600,2350.601,(Laughter)
f000472,2350.601,2361.480,Well -- (APPLAUSE)  But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.
f000473,2361.480,2365.040,The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard.
f000474,2365.040,2375.160,"If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that."
f000475,2375.160,2376.080,One quick relevant specific.

f000478,2383.760,2393.520,"But this deal that we're doing with BAC and US Air and KLM and Northwest, guess who's on the president's campaign big time: a guy from Northwest."

f000484,2417.960,2420.680,But that's happening as we sit here today.

f000487,2435.480,2437.760,They're dying to get the commercial airline business.
f000488,2437.760,2440.800,Japan is trying to get the commercial airline business.
f000489,2440.800,2446.440,"I don't think there are any villains inside government on this issue, but there's sure a lot of people who don't understand business."
f000490,2446.440,2450.800,And maybe you need somebody up there who understands when you're getting your pocket picked.

f000494,2457.480,2460.880,"Why, I had a great response to that."
f000495,2460.880,2465.160,"All right, go ahead, quick, quickly."
f000496,2465.160,2466.320,Just very briefly.
n000165,2466.320,2467.320,(SILENCE)
f000497,2467.320,2470.600,I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists.
n000166,2470.600,2471.320,(SILENCE)
f000498,2471.320,2481.240,We ought to make them disclose the people they've given money to when they're testifying before congressional committees; we ought to close the lawyers' loopholes; they ought to have to disclose when they're really lobbying.
f000499,2481.240,2490.080,"And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests."
f000500,2490.080,2490.720,I agree with that.

f000501,2491.360,2497.680,We've wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry.

n000168,2499.320,2499.720,(SILENCE)
f000503,2499.720,2502.920,But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy.
f000504,2502.920,2513.080,Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.
f000505,2513.080,2518.680,What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways.
f000506,2518.680,2520.200,And we're in real trouble on that.
f000507,2520.200,2520.201,(APPLAUSE)
f000508,2520.201,2524.280,I'm going to be in real trouble if I don't bring out -- it's now time...

f000510,2526.720,2527.200,OK.
f000511,2527.200,2533.200,I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on 1 thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this administration.

f000515,2543.320,2543.800,Thank you.
f000516,2543.800,2545.200,Now we're going to move to the 2nd half...
f000517,2545.200,2546.440,Now give me 1 second...
f000518,2546.440,2547.800,We're going to move to the...
f000519,2547.800,2548.640,I've volunteered.
f000520,2548.640,2553.960,"Now, look, I'm just kind of a, you know, cur dog here; I was put on the ballot by the people, not special interests."
f000521,2553.960,2555.440,So I have to stand up for myself.
f000522,2555.440,2557.360,"Now, Jim, let me get it out."
f000523,2557.360,2566.920,"On the 2nd debate, I offered, since both sides want the enterprise zones and we can't get together, I said I'll take a few days off and go to Washington and hold hands with you and we'll get it done."

f000524,2567.280,2573.640,"I'll take a few days off and hold hands with you and get this airlines thing straightened, because that's important to this country."

f000527,2578.361,2580.560,"All right, I want to bring in..."
f000528,2580.560,2582.160,"But if they do -- if they do, it's easy to fix."
f000529,2582.160,2586.160,"If you all want the enterprise zones, why don't we pass the dang thing and do it, right?"
f000530,2586.160,2586.600,All right.
f000531,2586.600,2589.640,Now we're going to bring in 3 other journalists to ask questions.
f000532,2589.640,2597.320,"They are Susan Rook of CNN, Gene Gibbons of Reuters and Helen Thomas of United Press Intl."
f000533,2597.320,2599.160,"You thought you'd never get in here, did you?"
f000534,2599.160,2599.360,Uh-uh.

f000537,2600.081,2612.440,OK we're going to continue on the subject of leadership and the first question goes to Gov Clinton for a 2-minute answer.
f000538,2612.440,2613.680,It will be asked by Helen Thomas.
f000539,2613.680,2614.000,Helen?

f000542,2630.280,2633.680,If I had it to do over again I might answer the questions a little better.
f000543,2633.680,2643.480,"You know, I'd been in public life a long time and no one had ever questioned my role and so I was asked a lot of questions about things that happened a long time ago and I don't think I answered them as well as I could have."

n000177,2648.520,2649.440,(SILENCE)
f000546,2649.440,2650.000,I couldn't help that.
f000547,2650.000,2653.760,"I felt very strongly about it, and I didn't want to go at the time."
f000548,2653.760,2657.600,It's easy to say in retrospect I would have done something differently.
n000178,2657.600,2658.160,(SILENCE)
f000549,2658.160,2665.280,"President Lincoln opposed the war and there were people who said maybe he shouldn't be president, but I think he made us a pretty good president in wartime."

f000551,2675.840,2678.040,So the answer is I could do that.

f000566,2745.040,2748.120,"And I think it's this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft."

f000568,2751.820,2753.360,But it's this pattern.
f000569,2753.360,2768.400,"And again, you might be able to make amendments all the time, Governor, but you've got to, as president, you can't be on all these different sides, and you can't have this pattern of saying well, I did this or I didn't, then the facts come out and you change it."
f000570,2768.400,2770.800,That's my big difference with him on the draft.
