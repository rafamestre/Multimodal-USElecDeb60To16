Due to copyright reasons, we cannot publicly provide the videos, but we provide the list of YouTube links where they can be found. Unfortunately, some of the videos had to be manually edited so that they could be aligned with the transcripts (more information in the paper). However, we do provide the post-processed audio features extracted from each utterance as a Python pickle object. This allows to reproduce the training and results of our paper. This file can only be found in the Zenodo archive, due to its large size. (Feel free to contact the authors about the videos).

The subfolder called "*plain*" has the transcripts of the debates in "plain" format (that is, one line per sentence without speaker), which is used by the *aeneas* alignment tool to perform the audio-text alignment.
