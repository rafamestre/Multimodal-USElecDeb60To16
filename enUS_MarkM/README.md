## Notes

This folder would contain the artificial voices for each utterance in the dataset with the Mark voice from Microsoft at a rate of 200, as well as its audio features in a pickle file. In this GitHub release, we cannot add these files are they are too heavy, but they are included in the Zenodo release, so please check that.
